If players do not maintain and defend their realm, they will be raided and a proportion of their resources stolen.\r\nAs a fully on-chain game, the choices that players make will shape the ever-evolving economy and ongoing metagame.\r\n\r\nA detailed overview can be found in the Master Scroll. \r\n\r\nAs one of the largest projects borne out of the Lootverse, Bibliotheca is shepherding the Loot ecosystem onto L2 (Starknet) and weaving together various Loot projects through gaming and storytelling. * Learn more about the wider Lootverse here at Loot.foundation\r\n\r\nWe’ve recently launched the Lootverse Atlas, an interconnected map that ties together multiple CC0 NFT projects into a unified map, brought to life with lore and stories\r\n\r\nWe plan to launch Desiege, a “tower defense” mini-game in the coming weeks, which will be one of the first multiplayer fully on-chain games on Starknet.\r\n\r\nLong term, our goal is to advance the L2 on-chain gaming ecosystem by engineering open-source public goods to help solve the engineering problems teams face.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to working in the open, and as we discover hard problems on the bleeding edge of L2, we are paving the way for the next generation of on-chain gaming.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nBibliotheca started as a weekend hackathon in early September with RedBeard and LordOfAFew, and shortly thereafter, the Bibliotheca team joined together with the Realms team.  The initial vision quickly evolved into something far greater: an ever-expanding on-chain hyperverse of interactive and fun meta-games built on a L2 network.\r\n\r\nToday, the DAO is collectively owned and steered by Loot Realms token holders and has $620k USD in the community-owned treasury.\r\n\r\nThe team consists of full-stack developers, web3 builders and game designers.\r\n\r\nDiscord (6700 members)\r\nTwitter (7800 followers)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we are building/built\r\n\r\nVisit our OS repositories https://github.com/BibliothecaForAdventurers\r\n\r\nSettling Game\r\nSettling Contracts (alpha .cairo)\r\nReact UI (alpha)\r\nMarketplace (alpha)\r\nER1155 AMM (alpha)\r\n\r\nOpen-source infrastructure \r\nStarkNet indexer (Ts, Apollo-server, graphql ) (pre-alpha)\r\n\r\nLootverse Atlas\r\nAn interconnected “Atlas” that ties together multiple CC0 NFT projects into a unified map, brought to life with lore and stories. https://atlas.bibliothecadao.xyz/ (production)\r\n\r\nDesiege: A Starknet Tower Defense Mini-Game\r\nA massively multiplayer on-chain “tower defense” game of multiplayer coordination  (alpha)\r\n\r\nLoot Bag Distillation and F2P Characters\r\nL1 NFT <> L2 NFT Bridge (StarkNet) (pre-alpha)\r\nDistillation of OG Loot bags into their individual elements onto StarkNet  (pre-alpha)\r\nEquipable items to a Character NFT  (pre-alpha)\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n\r\nA Vision for Massively Multiplayer On-Chain Gaming\r\nWe aspire to bring millions of players and builders working together on an entirely on-chain game.\r\n\r\nThe future is decentralised backends with centralised frontends. The entirety of this plan revolves around the game state being entirely on-chain which is communicated to via a client. This initial game client (Settling) will be managed by Bibliotheca DAO, however, anyone can come and create their own client if they choose to.\r\n\r\nA Decentralized Team with Aligned Incentives\r\nThe Bibliotheca DAO has been encouraging development on the protocol via a DAO model using LORDS grants. These grants will be awarded either retroactively or actively according to the specific job completed.\r\n\r\nAdvancing the Starknet ecosystem and ZK movement\r\nAfter much experimentation (deploying an Alpha on Arbitrum) and deliberation, StarkNet was chosen as the ideal L2 solution for its superior call data compression and composability. Inclusion for the next 1M players on-chain needs to exist in a cheap and secure transaction network, only possible due to recent L2 innovations.\r\n\r\nA Commitment to Open Source Development\r\nSince its inception, all development has been completed in the open in tandem with the community, with the majority being open-source from day 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- BibliothecaDAO

It's literally what we're doing.\r\n\r\nThe Thesis\r\n\r\nRight now, we're wrecking Earth (us, humanity 👋), and she's laughing bitterly because the way we're trying to \"help her\" is by selling carbon credits to \"offset the global effects of CO2.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth that Nature knows, the truth that makes her laugh bitterly, is that those carbon credits are not enough. There are two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The carbon credit issuers have the same incentives as Fannie May & Freddie Mac in 2007. These issuers are supposed to *validate* that the credits are reliable, but they're also *paid* when the credits are validated. Remember how that incentive mix treated us in 2008? \r\n\r\n\r\nAttribution\r\n\r\nYeah, that didn't go well.\r\n\r\nBut there's a much bigger concern. \r\n\r\nWho cares if Carbon Credits are worthless if they're actually detrimental? That's right, we said it, shockingly obvious fact coming your way:\r\n2. ⭐️ Reducing CO2 in the atmosphere isn't enough ⭐️\r\n\r\nJust as investors hold a diversified portfolio, Nature has a diverse set of risks to hedge against.\r\n\r\nIf Nature had a voice she would say, \"Sure, thanks for the CO2 scrubbers, but right now I'm just slightly more worried about how the UK has already lost up to 92% of its seagrass in the last century due to fertilizer runoff. And seagrass is, you know, the lungs of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nBut it doesn’t matter she can't say that; even if she had a voice we wouldn't listen. We need to give her money. Humans listen to money.\r\n\r\nThe Token\r\n\r\n\"Oh great, another 'save the earth token,' don't we have enough of these?\" Yeah we definitely do. We're not here to create a token that promises to donate some money to save whales. Gregarious megafauna is so web2.\r\n\r\nThis grant is not about a token, but rather about charting a credible path to realized impact.\r\n\r\nThe Brain\r\n\r\nGaia is the Greek Goddess of Earth. This digital brain we're building for her, however, is not mythological.\r\n\r\nWe're here to fund the development of a sense and response system for Earth's regeneration. We call it the Natural Intelligence Claim Engine. It's nice.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this Claim Engine natural is its core technology, Active Inference, an approach to Artificial Intelligence based on how organisms learn and act in natural systems.\r\n\r\nYou probably want to know how the claim engine works. Here's the sketch of its components:\r\n1. An incentive system that rewards people for providing data and contributing models.\r\n2. An Active Inference based scoring system for evaluating accurate models and rewarding impactful projects.\r\n3. An open forum where proposed projects can find funding based on their NICE score, and where investors and stewards can be rewarded by selling tokens to the Voluntary Carbon Offset Markets.\r\n4. (Endgame) An algorithmic trust fund managed by the NICE to which investors loan money. This flips the script so Nature herself can invest in the projects that she thinks are best.\r\n\r\nHow is Nature \"deciding\"?\r\n\r\nInstead of CO2 reduction, our measure of success is the reduction of free energy. Free energy is an integrated, context-specific measure of efficiency that is fundamental to our Natural Intelligence engine. Free energy can be calculated for any system with active inference agents as an indicator of the healthy trajectory of the system. The lower the free energy, the healthier the system. Some even argue that free energy is the value that Nature herself seeks to minimize; and that symbiosis of economy and ecology is possible in its pursuit.\r\n\r\nThat’s why the token returned is a Free Energy Reduction Numeraire: a FERN.\r\n\r\nHere's what we need to do:\r\n1. Architect the Natural Intelligence (NI) engine.\r\n2. Partner with academic researchers to input their domain models (like climate, agriculture, forestry, soil, etc.) as engine building blocks.\r\n3. Partner with experienced nature stewards, farm and forest managers, and indigenous people to develop and vet initial templates based on our building blocks.\r\n4. Run field tests with our partners, like Santa Fe Farms, to improve regenerative farming outcomes.\r\n5. Design and test tokenomics protocols that retroactively fund public goods.\r\n\r\nFund us so we can do those things. Also, you probably would have fun with our team.\r\n\r\nTeam & Partners\r\n\r\nOur initial team includes experts in the climate business, as well as the inventors of Natural Intelligence.\r\n\r\nTechnology\r\n- Rafael Kaufmann - Mathematical physicist, expert in systems modeling, Active Inference and collective intelligence.\r\n- Casper Hesp - Leading researcher in Active Inference. Former CTO of Nested Minds Network, the first company to build and commercialize Active Inference-based solutions.\r\n\r\nBusiness\r\n- Ned Harvey - Former Managing Director at Rocky Mountain Institute, a leading energy transition NGO.\r\n- Christian Wiesenthal - CorpDev specialist with extensive experience in carbon markets, climate finance and compliance, and corporate sustainability.\r\n\r\nPartners\r\n- Open Earth Foundation - Open source tech for planet Earth\r\n- CUB3 - Behavioral tokenomics experts\r\n- element6 Dynamics (formerly Santa Fe Farms) - Leaders in regenerative agriculture and nature-based solutions\r\n\r\nAdvisor\r\n- Karl Friston - The world’s number one neuroscientist by citations and the primary creator of Active Inference.\r\n\r\nFAQs\r\nQ: Why don't you use the term climate change here?\r\nA: Because if an arsonist was loose in your house with a flamethrower you wouldn't call it \"kitchen renovation\".\r\n\r\nQ: Why is your logo orange if you’re a climate company?\r\nA: Because oil companies have green logos these days\r\n\r\nQ: Ok, I funded you!

AND FUNNY.\r\n\r\nFrenemyeth is a gamified way to explore wallet statistics, where users can compare addresses to find out statistics, differences, and commonalities. \r\n\r\nWhile many link their ENS with their Twitter profiles as a first step towards transparency, there isn't an aggregated wallet statistics service that would enable people to get an overview of said ens addresses. \r\n\r\nFrenemy can be used from testing frenly rivalries to screening Twitter influencers, with the long term goal of summarising on-chain reputation and resumes. This way, Frenemy supports ENS in its journey of representing digital identity, improving the usability and community aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE GAME PLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nEach fight will be consist of 3 bouts. The best of 3 will win the fight. \r\n\r\nEach bout is a randomized metric, a randomizer will pick from a list of wallet metrics. So there is a chance to win and lose each time you replay the \"game\" with the same opponent\r\n\r\nI DON'T BELIEVE THIS OTHERWORLDLY IDEA IS EVEN POSSIBLE? WEN DEMO!\r\n\r\n\r\nGlad you asked! Our Playable Demo is live at:\r\n\r\nhttps://frenemy-eth.herokuapp.com/\r\n\r\nJust connect your wallet and choose to battle anyone! Vitalik.eth! Pranksy.eth!

NiftyGuilds uses Covalent APIs to get the information regarding the NFTs in the connected wallet. NiftyGuilds uses Textile ThreadDB to store all the chats, server information and channel information.

We assist experimental DTx projects and bring them into web3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepression is a big problem\r\n\r\nMental health is a serious problem. According to the WHO, 350 million people worldwide suffer from mental health. Two of the most common mental health conditions, depression and anxiety, cost the global economy US$ 1 trillion each year. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds.\r\n\r\nDigital therapies are now being accepted by professional bodies\r\n\r\nIn 2020 a video game got FDA approval for treating ADHD. The EU is funding research into using VR to stimulate parts of the mind in a similar way to when effectively treated with micro-dosing psychedelics for depression and exploring interconnectedness. VR is proven as a treatment for various mental health conditions; PTSD, depression, anxiety, phobias and much more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe focus on digital therapeutics that push emerging tech  \r\n\r\nWe prioritise forming close-knit relationships with the creatives, artists, academics and scientists we work with.\r\n\r\nDigital therapeutics are very broad category and a massive growing market, but mostly they tend to remain in traditional areas of medicine and therapies. The feedback loop of data and qualitative research is slow. There are many projects pushing the boundaries of what these can be but they often get lost in traditional gaming marketplaces or are behind closed research doors. Funding is difficult to access. We want to help bring the more innovative and boundary challenging examples of these into accessible and curated spaces and help them grow into a place that innovates and intersects with gaming & web3.\r\n\r\n🎮 VR/XR experiences + gamification - social VR platform \r\n👀 NFTs / mintable experiences to be shared, traded, evolved, iterated and voted upon by community. \r\n🌈Community/DAO funding novel digital therapeutics \r\n🖥️ integration of EEG & ECG sensors and machine learning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProjects we are supporting \r\n\r\nAltrd State \r\nAn immersive metaverse and gamified mental health platform that enables psychedelic and ego dissolving experiences through embodiment. It will be developed into a system that will enable composable assets to be shared as NFT’s in the metaverse, like digital wearables but they will be immersive experiences that can be carried, passed on and developed in collaboration and with the support of ongoing research in the fields of immersion and mind + body hacking.\r\n\r\nTTE\r\nTalking therapies in full embodiment. This project is gathering qualitative research in a social VR platform where therapies can be delivered in a shifting environment and not a static therapy room, and the patient can explore identity through full immersive embodiment in VR. This is a massive shift in how talking therapies can be delivered and qualitative research is needed as people explore identity in fluid ways through social VR. This is an entire paradigm shift in how we can deliver talking therapies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy a Gitcoin Grant \r\nIn 2022, we will be expanding our network with more talent, projects and value, while establishing DTx Dao as a creative incubator in experimental digital therapeutics with Web3 integration. The grant funding will go towards the curatorial, logistical and project management and labour needed for R&D and the setup of the DAO infrastructure and ultimately community tokenomics. As we begin to work with new projects and onboard their founders into the collective + incubator we will be developing structures to allocate funds to support the prototypes and upskill makers in web3 and decentralised integrations into their projects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe began working in the space of talking therapies in 2017 and experimental digital therapeutics in 2018.

Now, 12 years later, PizzaDAO is throwing the world a pizza party in his honor. On Bitcoin Pizza Day in 2021, we spent over $300,000 at more than 300 pizzerias and social impact organizations in over 60 countries to throw the World's Largest Pizza Party Ever. This year, we want all of web3 to be involved!\r\n\r\nBitcoin Pizza Day is already the one de facto Web3 holiday. Together as a community, we can grow this celebration of cryptocurrency and pizza into a truly global event. The internet, cryptocurrency, and pizza are already all global phenomena. Bringing them together by giving away free pizza funded by the blockchain is a strong invitation to the general public to join our Web3 ecosystem. \r\n\r\nWe will distribute all grant money collected in this round to pizzerias and social impact organizations all over the world, instructing pizzerias to give away $500 worth of pizza to their community on May 22nd and tip their staff $125 on top. In this way, we support small businesses and communities and spread our message far and wide. Our target of $1M USD on pizza at shops in over 100 countries is a strong example, a compelling soundbite, and an attainable goal.\r\n\r\nMAY 22: FREE PIZZA FUNDED BY CRYPTO\r\nBut how? We put together over $1M and spend it all on pizza! We invite every organization and community in Web3 to come together and make Free Pizza Day 2022 an international celebration and front-page news. To date, we've raised over $1M for the cause on our own and, using proceeds from our art sale, purchased more than $370,000 worth of real, edible pizza to date (you might have eaten some at ETHDenver). Now, we need your help!\r\n\r\nWHY? \r\nWe’re helping pizzerias around the world use crypto to empower their businesses while giving back to their communities. We believe that small businesses should be community owned and tokenizing the pizzerias in our network using open source technology is a good proof of concept. Beyond that, we believe that pizza is a public good and that Rare Pizzas’ Art to Pizza model can be replicated to solve some of the world’s biggest problems– while spreading joy.\r\n\r\nWe created Free Pizza Day as a participatory and fun way to apply blockchain technologies. Plus, throwing a global pizza party is a good team-building exercise for Spaceship Earth!\r\nWe believe markets can be positive sum and can enrich communities\r\nWe believe that we can use digital scarcity to bring analog plenty\r\nWe believe artists are important members of our community\r\nWe believe anyone should be allowed to help others without asking for permission\r\nWe believe memes are powerful vessels for raising awareness\r\nWe believe in equal inclusion of all pizza toppings (yes, even pineapple)\r\n\r\nTHE PIZZADAO MODEL \r\nRare Pizzas is a project founded by the decentralized autonomous organization PizzaDAO. We came together on February 18th, 2021 to make 10,000 generative pizzas in a one-of-a-kind collaboration between 314 international toppings artists. This collaboration has gone on to raise over $1M through the sale of the NFTs. \r\n\r\nNow, we're bringing together the largest community of pizzaioli in the world, compiling a database of pizza knowledge, and building the open source francheese Open Pizza. With this foundation, we’ll tokenize every pizzeria on planet earth and spread pizza and crypto throughout the universe.\r\n\r\nOUR IMPACT TO DATE\r\nOver 100,000 slices served\r\nOver 300 pizzerias supported\r\nPresence in 60+ countries\r\nOver $350,000 spent on pizza\r\nHundreds of people onboarded to Web3\r\n\r\nCITIES WE’VE SERVED\r\nNYC\r\nMiami\r\nDenver\r\nMexico City\r\nCochabamba\r\nParis\r\nBerlin\r\nAccra\r\nKarachi\r\nShanghai\r\nSeoul\r\nSydney\r\nAnd many more!\r\n\r\nTIMELINE\r\nJanuary 2021 -- PizzaDAO Founded\r\nFebruary 2021 -- Rare Pizzas NFT Founded\r\nMarch 2021 -- Rare Pizzas Box Sale Raises 300 ETH\r\nMay 22 2021 -- PizzaDAO Spends >$300k worldwide on pizza 60+ countries\r\nMarch 2022 -- Fundraising, shop onboarding and event sponsorship \r\nApril 2022 -- Fundraising and shop participation confirmations  \r\nMay 2022 -- Processing payments, awareness-raising, and party planning \r\nMay 22, 2022 (Bitcoin Pizza Day) -- GLOBAL PIZZA PARTY \r\nPost-party -- Developing the open source francheese Open Pizza\r\n\r\nWHO WE ARE\r\nWe are a global community of hackers, pizza enthusiasts, NFT creators, collectors, artists and rebels that want to change the pizza industry (and the world!). PizzaDAO’s community is made up of new entrants to the industry and members that have been in the web3 space for years, including several Gitcoin KERNEL Fellows and past award recipients.

Sunni with an Eye has joined together to create a sustainable community for all people that want to live with the earth and not just on it. The goal for Millennials for Sustainability is to create a commune- like community for the houseless and impovershed people of the America. Each NFT sold will contribute 50% of all funds raised to the project. This project has been revamped since 2018 from Tiny Homes for the Homeless to what it is today; google to see my efforts. As an autistic artist I have love and compassion for most people but getting my message out is challenging as I also suffer from social anxiety, however I am determined to use art, organization and will power to get this movement going not only for my community but communities nationwide. The goal is to build dome homes in the physical world to mirror the meta space I am creating in simulation to the commune. NFT buyers will help to build furnish and upgrade homes for commune members by building in a simulation game. I am currently a solo entity on this project and in my small company. I am working to recruit my 5 children to not only build a sense of community and philanthopy in them but so that they can learn and grow into the company they'll inherit.","reference_url":"https://sunflowerreign.com/about-1","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/28c8dd456dc57da784da6e5e9dbdd756/photo-1.png","admin_address":"0xC21EcC60423FdC03aecD62D63B5621F58DDb016e","amount_received":"103.0000","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-104244295,"related":[[12,9],[5040,4],[4863,4],[4093,4],[5108,4],[4098,3],[5386,3],[5093,3],[5082,3],[5045,3],[5005,3],[4913,3],[4883,3],[4124,3],[5371,3],[5332,3],[5029,3],[4944,3],[4912,3],[4791,3],[4327,3],[5198,3],[5158,3],[2900,2],[4249,2],[5245,2],[4885,2],[4879,2],[4869,2],[5211,2],[5033,2],[4867,2],[4080,2],[4251,2],[4200,2],[4114,2],[4012,2],[2924,2],[2200,2],[177,2],[5103,2],[5100,2],[4853,2],[4740,2],[5468,2],[5318,2],[5316,2],[5222,2],[5132,2],[5106,2],[5090,2],[5037,2],[4981,2],[4938,2],[4924,2],[4923,2],[4905,2],[4349,2],[3979,1],[375,1],[5140,1],[4926,1],[4786,1],[4780,1],[4779,1],[4151,1],[4014,1],[3531,1],[2985,1],[2952,1],[2902,1],[2823,1],[2631,1],[2599,1],[2292,1],[2121,1],[1573,1],[2096,1],[1761,1],[1628,1],[1595,1],[1403,1],[1325,1],[1252,1],[1051,1],[855,1],[798,1],[615,1],[524,1],[517,1],[223,1],[49,1],[5070,1],[5036,1],[5035,1],[4840,1],[4881,1],[4575,1],[4073,1],[4069,1],[4054,1],[3062,1],[4007,1],[3963,1],[2922,1],[2809,1],[2213,1],[1668,1],[1809,1],[1693,1],[795,1],[1669,1],[1155,1],[539,1],[490,1],[351,1],[331,1],[308,1],[191,1],[63,1],[24,1],[13,1],[5087,1],[4992,1],[4794,1],[5372,1],[5365,1],[5334,1],[5178,1],[5098,1],[5062,1],[5031,1],[5008,1],[4943,1],[4897,1],[4500,1],[4335,1],[4097,1],[4878,1],[4874,1],[4851,1],[4842,1],[4808,1],[4732,1],[4657,1],[4622,1],[4310,1],[4240,1],[4197,1],[4000,1],[3994,1],[3645,1]],"upcoming":-100010507,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1648628758.7999706,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1648663766.9333882,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1648663331.9423947},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":353135,"url":"/sunniwithaneye","name":"SunniwithanEye","handle":"sunniwithaneye","keywords":[],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/e4e6e448e07d657683ed35f77df1b0f1/sunniwithaneye.png","github_url":"https://github.com/sunniwithaneye","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},"team_members":[{"id":353135,"url":"/sunniwithaneye","name":"SunniwithanEye","handle":"sunniwithaneye","keywords":[],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/e4e6e448e07d657683ed35f77df1b0f1/sunniwithaneye.png","github_url":"https://github.com/sunniwithaneye","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.6342381109416414,0.0],[1.0,1.4055022665528,0.7712641556111587],[10.0,2.9230800120527887,2.288841901111147],[100.0,6.699714189169517,6.065476078227875],[1000.0,13.363230971243755,12.728992860302114],[10000.0,20.22255976571724,19.588321654775598]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"103.0000","positive_round_contributor_count":4,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/28c8dd456dc57da784da6e5e9dbdd756/photo-1.png"],"details_url":"/grants/5426/millennials-for-sustainability"},{"id":5422,"active":true,"title":"EXOTHIUM  -

The map of this game is completely unknown at the beginning. Each player chooses one of four races to participate and in the first stages of the game, there will be a fight for survival and exploration of the map.\r\nAs the map is being unveiled, the story for the current players and future ones will start to take shape, this means that the actions and decisions of the players will have a direct impact in the lore of the game. Players will be able to leave a legacy for the future and a very important aspect of the adventure is the team work, for example, when gathering resources and exploring this new world.\r\nAs the time passes in the game, new technologies will become available that will make it easy to endure the hardships of the land and life. Four “ages” are planned, starting in the EXPLORATION AGE, and the game will evolve in real time to METAL AGE and subsequent DARK AGE, and finally MEDIEVAL AGE.\r\nThe in-game days will be faster at the beginning and as time goes by, the speed will decrease until it stabilises in the MEDIEVAL AGE. In the first eras, the game will be focused on exploration, gathering, survival and cooperation where each player is incentivised to walk in a group to increase the chances of survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map is procedurally generated and the name of the players will forever be in the game when new landmarks like rivers, lakes, caves, oceans etc, are found by them.\r\nIn the beginning, each step taken in the map is a step into the unknown with many possibilities. While exploring, a player will gather information for future identification of any findings made on the map. With a bag it is possible to pick up items to craft for example weapons or construct buildings. These buildings will offer shelter to better resist the weather and keep a group of explorers with the necessary strength for the next few days.\r\nThe explorers will be able to encounter animals, mountains, plains, caves, herbs, etc. For example, each new cave will be randomly identified for mining or as a dungeon. If a player encounters a dungeon, he can be part of the history of that dungeon and in the future it will open to group exploration and monster fights.\r\nThere will be a necessity for some players to be dedicated solely to professions like hunting, gathering and farming to help the community to grow and keep the map exploration going.\r\nWeather will also be crucial to plant crops and decide the next steps of the exploration and each day the players have to make wise choices to increase the likelihood of finding what they want.\r\nDungeons will reward players with different achievements and items that will be in their legacy forever.\r\nEach character will have a fixed lifetime and there will be mechanisms to breed and generate new characters, allowing players to extend their legacy, increase the game's population and enabling other participants to play the game via selling or gifting these new characters.\r\nThis is the beginning of a new metaverse entirely generated by real people, constructed by real people and planned by real people.\r\nNo more pay to win or play to earn, we want players to have fun and search for real connections with other like minded people which seek to be part of a game that allows a never ending exploration, with survival elements like d&d mixed up with a sandbox mmorpg.\r\nThe lore for the game will be minimal at first and the vast majority of the story will be constructed as the game progresses, making it possible for players to become part of the history. \r\n\r\nWhat we intend for Metaverse:\r\nA tech enabled way to Own, Play, Work, Create, and Live outside of four walls\r\n\r\nTarget audience: old school rpg players, board game lovers and blockchain community oriented individuals;\r\n\r\nTech Summary: We are building a game using Starknet to enable multiple actions and a feature rich environment. Starknet will give us the ability to do the heavy computation like calculating shortest paths and simulating heather.\r\n\r\nCore features:\r\n- Procedural generated tiles (exploration of the world)\r\n- Cooperation  (every player will help build the future of the game)\r\n- Player driven (players will decide the future implementations on the game/s)\r\n\r\nEras: Exploration Age (This is the starting age). For now we won’t define new eras, since it will be decided by the community. \r\n\r\nMap: Each zone has a set of traits that will be generated each time a player explores a new zone. Note that each zone will have influence on the creation of an adjacent zone based on traits. A zone is a set of 19 hexagonal tiles (50 meters wide each tile). \r\n\r\nTraits of a zone:\r\ntemperature\r\nmoisture\r\nsoil fertility\r\nfeatures (water, unknown, etc…).\r\npassable \r\n\r\nTraits of a tile:\r\naltitude\r\nfeatures (unknown)\r\n* unknown is DAO decided in the future.\r\n\r\nBuildings: Huts and Storage Huts; \r\n\t\tThese building are only for item storage and resting purposes. Visually they will fit in an hex tile (with transparency in the bottom so players can also see the traits of the terrain)\r\n\r\nRaces: Monkeys, Cats, Dogs, Punks;\r\n\t\r\n hair color\r\n eye color\r\n skin color\r\n\r\nCharacters: Each player has, at least, 1 playable character. Each character starts with all the stats at 1 (initially we will only have age, stamina and fertility)\r\n\r\nPFP (Profile picture):\r\nThe floating head character is designed to be easily integrated with other project profile picture or even embroidered in our clothes.\r\nIn this way the multipurpose NFT will give us more freedom to explore new frontiers in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResolution:

- visual block explorer","slug":"icevision-visual-block-explorer","description":"Icevision.xyz is a visual block explorer that aims to make the state more intelligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nWeb3 is open state\r\nCrypto and Web3 is built on openness – open protocols and data.\r\nActual blockchain data is low-level, and hard to make sense of. Try understanding protocols by looking at the transactions on Etherscan.\r\nUnderstanding how protocols work under the hood is hard, but it is also very important that many do understand for increased decentralisation.\r\nIceVision makes this state intelligible.\r\nIce Vision converts smart contracts and data flows to flow charts.\r\nThe charts are easily read by humans.\r\nIt allows for better understanding of the shared open state.\r\n\r\nUse cases\r\nIcevision is building a general purpose block explorer and so the amount of use cases is vast. Some areas which we believe that visualisation can be extra useful:\r\nProtocol documentation.\r\nProtocol surveillance - e.g. surveillance of L1 contracts for L2s.\r\nCode reviews and auditing smart contracts.\r\nDAO tooling. E.g.

is a platform for the world’s artists to cut with the emotion of their NFTs right into the hearts of a global audience, and create total compassion for the suffering of Ukrainians under Russian invasion.  \r\n\r\nPoignART was envisioned as a way to solve for trust misalignment between artists and collectors hoping to support the Ukrainian people; either through their work or their purchase.  I noticed immediately after joining UkraineDAO and Unchain Discord that a large number of people wanted to help by contributing artwork, and a smaller number of people were actively attempting to grift.  It became very energy intensive to discern who was genuinely trying to help support Ukraine and who was there for their personal benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we created PoignART for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1.)  Artists and Collectors can be certain that 100% of their created value was being donated to the Ukrainian people\r\n2.)  Many artists might not have extra funds to mint pieces; so we built PoignART with lazy minting\r\n3.)  To create an outlet which could channel the raw emotion being experienced by people both in Ukraine and outside Ukraine\r\n4.)  To harness the very thing that Putin fears; the right to self-determination, freedom of speech and expression, and to wield it against him and his supporters\r\n5.)  We named it after the Poignard, a long thin dagger used to pierce armor and wound the heart\r\n\r\nFebruary 24th, 2022 Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, one of the largest countries in Europe and home to 44 million people. This devastating attack on Ukraine and on European democracy has shattered peace in the entire world. Many Ukrainians abroad and people all over the word want to help and join the cause. Web3 has brought us all together, a group of volunteers who deeply care about Ukraine, its people, and about the freedom and wellbeing of innocent citizens. Some of us are Ukrainians, some have friends, family and loved ones trapped under Russian occupation, and others deeply care about people suffering from this uncalled and unprovoked terror attack. Crypto enthusiasts immediately mobilized their skills, expertise, and efforts to help Ukraine.  Various DAOs and groups have risen and many seem to have a common struggle – the inability to provide artists a way to contribute their talents to the cause. In this moment of need, an idea was conceived to build a platform for artists, these heroes would donate their art to the needs of the Ukrainian people. We built a platform that would mint their art into NFTs; in the fastest and most efficient way. PoignART was born. \r\n.\r\n\r\n\tNARRATIVE\r\n\r\nWe at PoignART are united around one strategic goal: help the Ukrainian people defend the freedom and sovereignty of their country.  Help the Ukrainian people shield their nation from the aggression of Putin and the Russian troops. We wanted to create a channel for the emotions of artists everywhere.  Whether that art becomes a shield for the Ukrainian people or a Poignard which wounds the heart of the unwitting accomplice.\r\n\r\nThe PoignART team’s focus is to become the bridge between NFT artists, collectors and NGOs. Our goal is to provide the tools to empower every artist with the ability to turn their digital art into NFTs which support the Ukrainian people directly. PoignART provides an NFT minting platform to all artists willing to donate their art.  Any sale proceeds will be fully donated Unchain.fund (100%) – a charity project founded to help Ukraine and stewarded by blockchain & crypto activists.  The donation addresses are immutable; and we never handle the funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tKEY ACHIEVEMENTS\r\n\r\nIn under 2 weeks the team has achieved a tremendous amount of work. Highlights:\r\nDiscord server configured.\r\nMission Statement document created outlining the project objectives and manifesto.\r\nTeam structure defined with parallel work streams of developers, artists, designers, writers, coordinators, and managers.\r\nSocial presence initiated (Twitter, Instagram, Medium).\r\nCritical aesthetics defined.\r\nWebsite private alpha launched\r\nTesting has been largely successful \r\nPlatform development at a 85% completion, pending QA phase. \r\nCustom Frontend, Backend and Smart Contract\r\nPromo video with custom music in progress.\r\nArtist sign-up in progress.\r\nCurated collection in progress.\r\nSignificant world-class partnerships \r\n \r\n\r\n\tOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe main goals of this project are:\r\nTo give an opportunity to all the artists to donate their art.\r\nSupport the Ukrainian people in their darkest hour.\r\nSolve the trust misalignment between collectors and artists.\r\nTo provide a decentralized platform where collectors can easily mint art into NFTs and buy the donated NFT art.\r\nTo welcome new donors from the web3 / crypto community to increase the overall donations.\r\nTo educate and bring more people into the web3 community through the onboarding process onto PoignART platform. \r\nTo amplify the importance of reciprocal charity and emphasize NFT philanthropy as the new go-to of impact and giving back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBUDGET \r\n\r\nPoignART team so far has invested their personal time, energy, resources, skills, and funds into the project. Despite the fact that some of the costs involve one-time purchases or have been covered by the individuals of our team, it will be necessary to plan for future funding of certain aspects of the project. These costs include maintenance of the website, servers, platform support, community management, social media activity etc. \r\nWe have established that the following are our financial needs over one year:\r\n\r\nInfura Subscription: $600-2400/year\r\n\r\nContract Deployment: $800-1200/one time\r\n\r\nDomains: $150\r\n\r\nDaily Merkle Root updates: $620 the first month\r\n\r\nTwice weekly Merkle Root updates: $1300 for eleven months\r\n\r\nVercel Subscription: $140/year\r\n\r\nMisc. Subscriptions: $300/year\r\n\r\nTotal Costs for one year: $3910-$6110\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWe believe that the initial funding of $8,790 will be sufficient to cover the operational expenses and guarantee the platform scalability. It is imperative that we ensure a stable and high-performing software as we anticipate expanding rapidly with more users getting onboard, resulting in more donations and funds raised for the needs of

- Physically-Backed NFT Apparel using Nearfield Communication","slug":"sockhodler-physically-backed-nft-apparel-using-ne","description":"As the NFT ecosystem grows more saturated, users are beginning to seek utility alongside the artwork they purchase to accumulate value from it over time.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we are building\r\nWe are currently building a true physically-backed NFT apparel brand using Near Field Communication.  An NFC Tag is bonded to our socks and is linked to the blockchain via a paired NFT that is minted on the Algorand Blockchain. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur goal is to not only provide an environment where crypto veterans can support their favorite artists or projects by buying their branded apparel but also to help onboard crypto newbies by providing a physical component to help educate people on how NFTs work and the value they can provide.  \r\n\r\nThe user will be able to verify the authenticity of the creation as well as prove ownership.  \r\nThis system is currently being built and will include the following:\r\n- Authentication page displaying NFT data including token id, owner address, creator address, total supply, and circulating supply\r\n\r\n- Dashboard that will deliver dynamic daily content to the user daily once the Nearfield Communication tag is authenticated\r\n\r\n- Wallet Integration with myAlgo, Pera Wallet, and AlgoSigner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to encourage active users, we are implementing several programs where owners can interact with their collectible apparel on a daily basis.  Here is a summary of some initiatives that we are implementing:\r\n\r\n- Daily rewards program from scanning the socks with a mobile phone\r\n\r\n- NFT Staking (to earn SOCKS Tokens)  for users who have purchased physically-backed socks\r\n\r\n- Weekly Giveaways and Offers from partner projects and brands\r\n\r\n- An exclusive marketplace for limited edition NFT apparel not sold on the public-facing e-commerce site\r\n\r\n- An NFT Auction environment where users can bid on SockHodler NFTs\r\n\r\n- We are also exploring opportunities to allow users to unlock “Scan Streaks” and level up their NFTs over time by unlocking more features and upgraded NFT artwork.\r\n\r\nHow can you help?\r\nAs you know, development requires careful planning and iteration, so we must complement our funding with other sources to achieve our goals. \r\n\r\nYour donations will help:\r\n- Refine user experience of the dApp and its features\r\n\r\n- Create the Marketplace and NFT Auction modules\r\n\r\n- Refine payment gateway into a robust Algorand shopping cart\r\n\r\n- R&D/Implementation for leveling up NFTs using mutable CIDs\r\n\r\n- R&D of embedding wallets into Nearfield Communication Tags (End to End Authentication System & Crypto Wallet)\r\n\r\n- Offset recurring expenses such as web hosting, IPFS file pinning subscription, and development costs\r\n\r\nOther ways you can help out:\r\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/SockHodler\r\nGive us feedback on Discord: https://discord.gg/8zD6BnTup2\r\nStar our Repo on Github: https://github.com/sockhodler/sockhodler_frontend\r\nCheck out our website: https://www.sockhodler.com\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out on Twitter or Discord if you have any questions.  We are a small project looking to expand and bring new use-cases to the blockchain ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reference_url":"https://www.sockhodler.com","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/de3adf8f02460d34118c7b78e7b960b4/GitCoin.png","admin_address":"0x0","amount_received":"0.0000","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any

Mainframe”: The First Hobbyist Bio-Computer","slug":"metabolic-mainframe-the-first-hobbyist-bio-comput","description":"The need:\r\nThere is a need for an accessible synthetic biology platform. Currently, people are limited by expensive equipment and reagents, long Design-Build-Test-Learn cycles and paywalled research papers. Necessary reagents of purified enzymes are often proprietary and require a cold chain (-80 C), and many experimental workflows require high-speed centrifugation. Most of the hardware needed for wet-lab work is prohibitively expensive and DNA libraries are expensive to acquire and often difficult to use.\r\n \r\nThe solution: \r\nAn open source “metabolic mainframe” which allows DIYBiologists to tinker at home. \r\nImportant reagents can be freeze-dried and stored at room temperature for long periods, then re-hydrated for use. Instead of transforming DNA constructs into cells, “biochemical breadboards” (cell-free lysates) are now commonly used to rapidly test pathways. Open source hardware projects can cut equipment costs down 2-50x and projects such as FreeGenes are making needed sequences freely available to all. A “metabolic mainframe”, similar to the Arduino or Altair 8800, will grow an ecosystem which is decentralized, hacker-friendly and freely shares scientific results.\r\n\r\nMilestones:\r\nAcquire remaining Hardware and reagents needed for fully functional lab\r\nFirst successful plasmid assembly on OpenDrop\r\nFirst successful protein expression in \"biochemical breadboard\"\r\nFirst successful DNA sequencing with Nanopore Minion\r\nPublish results openly via micropub and youtube videos\r\nStretch milestone: complete a Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle within a single day! \r\n\r\nFuture Milestones:\r\nDIY oligo or gene synthesis w/ TdT or DropSynth\r\nCreate functional freeze-dried reagents in-house \r\n\r\nFunding requirements:\r\n \r\nHardware: \r\nNanopore Minion: $1000\r\nOpenDrop: $1200 \r\nFluorescence detection: $800\r\nUltrafast PCR: ~$500\r\nDNA synthesis setup: $500\r\nProgrammable Fermentation: $990\r\n \r\nDNA:\r\nLibraries: free\r\nOligos: Definitely not free, ~$500\r\n \r\nReagents: $2000\r\n \r\nDisposables: $200, I’ll try to use reusables wherever possible\r\n \r\nTotal: $7690\r\n \r\nAdditional links\r\nBiomolecular Breadboards\r\nOpenDrop\r\nThe FreeGenes Project\r\nTech Specs – Chi.Bio\r\nDropSynth\r\nUltrafast PCR\r\nDemonpore\r\nOriCiro\r\n\r\nThank you for your support!

Toolbox","slug":"treat-toolbox","description":"Treat Toolbox is the best way to create Generative Artwork for use in NFT collections. Simply bring your layered artwork and define attributes and rarities, and our tool takes care of the rest. Treat Toolbox goes farther than any tool of its kind, allowing for highly customized layer combinations based upon rules you define. It has already been used to create dozens of large NFT collections to jumpstart large, successful web3 communities.\r\n\r\nOur code is MIT licensed, and further supported through a paid, hosted version that offers convenience and team collaboration.\r\n\r\nHigh Level Summary:\r\n\r\nSimple, Web-Based UI: a point-and-click portal that’s designed for anyone to use. Invite your collaborators, define your royalty split, and bring your collection to market!\r\nGenerative & Pre-Rendered: Combine layered artwork with rarities you define, or if you have your own custom process, bring your finished pieces and leverage all the tool has to offer.\r\n100% Customizable: Every detail is in your hands from titles, supply, royalties and artwork, all the way down to symbols and metadata.\r\nProven Record: Treat Toolbox was created out of necessity for the launch of The Skeleton Crew. It has since been used successfully across countless Solana launches.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Features:\r\n\r\nMetadata Templating: Customize NFT names and URLs using templating variables. No more hand editing metadata – incorporate numbers “Monke #16”, or even an attribute value like “solhouse.io/at/250-main-st”.\r\nTrait Sets: imagine you have multiple characters in one collection. Trait Sets allow you to group some or all of your attributes into separate sets.\r\nConflict Resolution: what if a few randomly generated combinations don’t work well together. Mark them as conflicts and they’re as good as gone!\r\nAdvanced Layering: split an attribute’s artwork into two parts. Imagine arms where the left arm is in front of an object while the right is behind!\r\nMetadata-only Traits: add a unique name, or a bit of lore to an NFT; no art required. And use artwork-only traits to throw a texture on top!\r\nDuplicate Detection Exclusions: is a different background color alone really enough for an NFT to be unique? Treat Toolbox lets you decide.\r\n\r\nA grant would allow us to further the product, improving workflow UX, adding compatibility for additional chains, more media types, and covering advanced use cases requested by our community.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAbout Us:\r\n\r\nThe Skeleton Crew is an NFT community, that launched on Oct 1, 2020 with the goal of highlighting artists that lacked access to technological means to create their own collections. We have since helped Artists create 3 communities of their own, Zen0verse by Zen0m, Longharbor & Cursed Mikes by Alejandro Mirabal, and DARKELV by Mars Dorian. Each launch, including our own, were fully facilitated through Treat Toolbox and the tools that we built. In addition to helping artists, we have a thriving #dev-skulls channel in our Discord where we and other community members help programmers new to web3 and ecosystem get help.

Spaces, I've been around the space for a long time, so it's very easy for us to get amazing builders, investors, community leaders, artists and flippers to talk about their journey and share the knowledge across.\r\n\r\nPreviously I've had amazing guests from Axie Infinity, SushiSwap, AAVE, MetaPurse, Yield Guild Games, Delphi Digital, Nansen, Proof of Humanity, and more to share their journey in the space.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to\r\nEducation about web3, DeFi, DAOs, NFTs, Metaverse\r\nUnderstand Crypto is way beyond trading & flipping\r\nExploring new scaling solutions and tech built in the ecosystem\r\nSimplify complex conversations to audience\r\nHave fun and make great content\r\n\r\nLinks of my

Zero Knowledge Battleship - Building State Channels and Sequencer-less Roll-up","slug":"battlezips-zero-knowledge-battleship-building-sta","description":"Overview\r\n\r\n\tBattleZips is a circom-based L1 (EVM) demonstration of Zero Knowledge for privacy and scalability. We presented a version of BattleZips with only privacy features at EthDenver 2022.\r\n\r\nRepositories:\r\nContracts/ Circuits\r\nSubgraph\r\nFront end\r\n\r\n\tWe are currently working around an issue with the snarkjs/ circomlibjs packages being unable to build in webpack and will have the game demo up at https://battlezips.com very soon. Until then, we have a 1-step guide to running the game in a development environment. \r\n\tIn the next month, we will be working with the consultation and potentially grant funding of the Ethereum Foundation's Privacy and Scalability Explorations team. The primary objective of BattleZips is to demonstrate scalability in our ZK battleship game. We will accomplish this by playing games over a peer-to-peer connection facilitating a state channel, with a final Zero Knowledge \"Proof of Battleship Game Validity\" roll-up of the game state in a merkle tree within a single transaction. \r\n\tThe secondary objective of BattleZips is to provide this game as an in-depth proof of concept / tutorial to new Zero Knowledge developers. In my time learning the Circom / SnarkJS stack I found the community to be amazingly supportive and the documentation to be neglected. While many bootcamps and courses now exist, we feel there is still a gap in non-academic asynchronous learning resources for Zero Knowledge. BattleZips has already produced a series on Solidity/ Circom 2.0 / SnarkJS for privacy. We intend to release another tutorial of the scalability architecture once it is developed to foster growth and innovation in L1 Zero Knowledge.\r\n\tThere is no concept of monetization in the BattleZips game. It is purely an exercise in research and development to prove concepts, with an emphasis on utilizing asynchronous means like a cryptozombies.io-style web app or YouTube tutorials to put the findings of this R&D in an easily accessible format in the public domain.\r\n\r\nTech Stack\r\n\r\nImplemented\r\nCircom 2.0 + circomlib for \"Board Validity\" and \"Shot Validity\" proofs\r\ncircomlibjs to generate mimcSponge hashes\r\nSnarkJS for ptau/ circuit compilation, verifier contract generation, and proving circuits in client and tests\r\ncircom_tester to provide code coverage of circuits\r\nSolidity for on-chain verification and storage of zk computation results\r\nIncludes tested ERC-2771 compatibility\r\nHardhat (hardhat-deploy) to deploy to etherscan/ polygonscan compatible chains with automatic source verification\r\nIPFS storage of circuit assets (*_verification_key.json, *.zkey, *.wasm)\r\nSubgraph indexing of BattleshipGame.sol events to render data in client\r\nReact + metamask front-end to drive dApp from GUI\r\n\r\nBeing Developed\r\nCircom2.0 + circomlib for \"Battleship Game Validity\" proof\r\nwill require incremental quinary merkle tree, eddsaPoseidon\r\nSwitch from mimcSponge hash to poseidon hash\r\nsocket.io facilitator of state channels\r\nECDH using babyJub keys to obscure game state from socket.io host\r\nDisconnected user can reconnect and request game state from other user\r\nOnline/ offline status in-game\r\nOn-chain game rollup\r\nVerifiable Delay Function for malicious/ neglectful timeout\r\nRoll up game state with proof of game correctness in one transaction\r\n\r\nTeam\r\n\r\nRe-linking to our team's presentation at EthDenver 2022 - our team has three Co-Founders: Jack Gilcrest, Ian Brighton, and Chris Robinson. Jack Gilcrest has been a professional Solidity developer for four years and began working with Circom to build a Zero Knowledge Battleship demo five months ago. Ian Brighton has been developing front-ends in the web3 space for two years, spent over a year prioritizing subgraph construction, and has also been working on the BattleZips project since EthAtlanta in October of 2021. Chris Robison is an experienced veteran in cryptocurrency and has clocked nearly 11 professional years in the space. Jack focuses entirely on ZK/ solidity, Ian works primarily on the UX while supporting the R&D done in ZK, and Chris serves as an \"ecosystem sherpa\" and advisor. All three of us are united in our desire to bring about wider adoption of Zero Knowledge technology.\r\n\r\nPlease join our discord and reach out to any of the \"Captain\" roles to follow up, or join just to follow us on our journey of building out a tutorial on building private, scalable Solidity dApps!\r\n\r\nGrant Scope\r\nWhether this grant receives $30,000 or $3, we will be building the BattleZips scalability infrastructure described as \"Being Developed\" in the \"Tech Stack\" section. We will consult with the Ethereum Foundation's Privacy and Scalability Explorations team, and will seek grant funding for about a month to fuel the construction of the scalability stack. We have *NOT* received any external funding for the BattleZips project yet, but intend to soon in the future and marked the option true for transparency purposes.\r\n\r\nFunding provided by this Gitcoin grant will go to:\r\nExpediting the timeline of the scalability R&D\r\nFunding the construction of scalability tutorial videos for Circom/ SnarkJS/ Solidity\r\nFunding the circumnavigation of the Webpack 5 / Circomlibjs + SnarkJS incompatibility errors to provide a production demonstration of the technology built to anyone with an internet connection and metamask\r\nIntegration of Biconomy + Torus to provide a production demonstration of the technology built to anyone with an internet connection and a google account","reference_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgtNEALhJ3s&list=PLWACGbvIsEgn44LlTiPgVkOC4nG8tnJX-","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/1d55dc5fb4f7b3b3fb187e35113cf8e2/battlezips.png","admin_address":"0xE41454EF99839e4F13FD724bc28a9d46EAEBf2c0","amount_received":"20.8012","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any

Users could input the address for a liquidity pool on tinyman. The returned wallets would almost certainly be a comprehensive list of arbitrage bots for that pool - valuable information for traders or individuals who hold large sums of the traded assets. B. Users could input the address of the creator of a new asset they’re considering as an investment. They could then check the returned addresses to see if any have been involved in rugpulls or other scams in the past. C. Users could input the address of a wallet that has been selling large sums of an asset. They could check the returned addresses to see if any wallets are associated with the development team. D.

We know our shit 😉🦄😎\r\n\r\nWe're now working with Filecoin to fully decarbonize their network from the genesis 💯♻️\r\n\r\nWith the grant we can accelerate development on many fronts, and experiment how to decarbonize other crypto networks and other non-crypto consumption behaviors.\r\nJoin us in reducing emissions and saving the planet with (non-visual) NFTs 💚🍀\r\n\r\n\r\n🚀 Mission \r\n\r\nEnergy is the biggest problem in climate change: 73% of greenhouse gasses are emitted by the energy sector; we must crash this number down to Zero, by incentivizing and simplifying the adoption of renewable energy and climate positive behaviors globally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🔭 Vision \r\nthat decarbonization is possible by \r\n• enabling developers to permissionlessly innovate in the space & build value added services on top of renewable energy purchases \r\n• allowing everybody, even you, to easily and automatically buy renewable energy to decarbonize everything in your life\r\n\r\nThose are the 2 main ingredients of our \"Programmable Sustainability\" vision: turn sustainability and green behaviors into a digital software that can be built and run by anyone\r\n\r\n![Zero Labs NFT web3 building block](https://zerolabs.green/files/imgs/20220313_ZeroLabs_at_SxSW_033.jpeg)\r\n\r\n\r\n🧩 What problem do we solve\r\n\r\nwe're disrupting the clean energy procurement industry, that is:\r\n\r\n• gated: accessible only to big corporate buyers and sellers with big budgets to hire consultants to navigate market complexities\r\n\r\n• slow: constrained and held back by lengthy and bureaucratic procurement and verification processes\r\n\r\n• disconnected: operated using old and centralized technical infrastructure and siloed databases \r\n\r\n\r\n🌱 How we're solving it\r\n\r\nby tokenizing Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) converting them into a web3 native building block, we’re:\r\n\r\n• making them easy, fast, digital, liquid, permissionless and programmable, \r\n\r\n• Democratizing access: enabling small sellers (eg people with solar panels on their roofs) and small buyers (eg households who consume relatively \"small\" amounts of electricity and are overlooked by the large intermediaries sellers because they are too small to matter) to participate in the market, easily buying and selling, \r\n\r\n• therefore we crypto-economically incentivize the decentralization of energy production from centralized power plants to a large network of distributed energy producers\r\n\r\n\r\n✅🧪🌱 What’s the solution we are building \r\n\r\nRenewable Energy Certificates are 💚 Green NFTs 💚 , that extend the EIP-1155 with the ability to \"claim\" or lock the NFT forever: only the end beneficiary would be able to say they are the buyer of the REC.\r\n\r\nBesides this custom feature the REC NFTs enable anything you expect from the advanced NFT standard\r\n•   Fractionalization: Key ingredient to allow even smaller buyers who consume amounts, less than <1MWh, to be able to participate\r\n•   Transferable\r\n•   Composable into other NFTs or ERC20 that represent pool tokens\r\nand therefore usable in different contexts from DeFi to the Metaverse\r\nEtc\r\n\r\nWe are ⛓️ Multichain ⛓️\r\nWe are building and deploying on the EnergyWeb chain, EVM compatible PoS,\r\nBut these NFTs can be minted on any chain that a dApp developer or end user desires. \r\n\r\nThere's 2 main layer2 and sidechains options we are considering:\r\n\r\n•    Polygon: because so much of the refi ecosystem is being deployed on Polygon, we're curious to see how RECs could interact with the other carbon offset based tokens on this ecosystem\r\n\r\n•    ZKsnarks and other privacy preserving chains: many REC buyers don't want to reveal some of the information about their energy consumption, locations, periods or company data. Zero knowledge solutions can solve this by proving certain data without revealing them\r\n\r\n\r\n📈 How far along are we\r\n\r\n•    We've been working on this project for almost 1.5 years\r\n\r\n•    We have tokenized 84.000 RECs (or 84.000 MWh) equivalent to\r\n 59.000 mTons of CO2 avoided \r\n= 7000 homes’ energy 🏠⚡️use for one year \r\n= 73.000 acres (295 Km2) 🌳🌳🌳 of US forests in one year - source\r\n\r\n•    We have a committed pipeline of requests and interests to tokenize ~1.5 TWh ( = 1.5 million RECs) or a18x increase in the next 3-4 months\r\n\r\n•    We are going to release the MVP of this iteration of the product in April\r\n\r\n\r\n⁉️ Why this /  Why now /  & Why RECs are better than Offsets\r\n\r\n\r\nRECs and carbon offsets are the two main market instruments for people and businesses that aren’t satisfied with the speed of climate policy implementation.\r\nBoth instruments are needed in the fight for climate change,\r\nHowever:\r\n\r\n•     Carbon offsets are all over the place, even in this round of Gitcoin grants, but no one, besides us, is tackling the REC market and the objective of REDUCING emissions 🔥📉0️⃣ rather than offsetting them 🤷‍♂️👉👩‍🌾\r\n\r\n•     RECs enable people and business to create direct demand for more renewable energy and verify their use of clean energy for reporting needs \r\n\r\n•     RECs are also easier to measure and verify than offsets, which maintain legacy challenges around measurement and verification, generated kWh of renewable energy can easily be measured in a deterministic way with meters\r\n\r\n\r\n💰🛠️ what we will do with the funding\r\n\r\nWe’re bootstrapped, supported by Filecoin and the projects we do with clients\r\n•     We need to audit the contracts that will be released in April\r\n•     We’d like to experiment on some crypto ideas and we need more devs (market rates are steep for a startup) to tackle these\r\n•     We want to enable more devs to use it so we need technical writing and community management\r\n•     With additional funding, we can research the right methodologies to calculate the electricity consumption of different contexts and build more tools for more use cases more quickly–such as powering any Ethereum-based dApp or ETH holdings and transactions with verified clean energy \r\n\r\n\r\n👩‍🚀👨‍🚀🚀 Team \r\n\r\nOur team is made of \r\n•     Ethereum veterans \r\nWe

We have started with analyzing consumer risk with users’ credit and reputation scores, and assessing financial market risk which would provide accredited trust ratings for DeFi markets and assets.\r\n\r\nChainscore addresses the limitations of permission-less DeFi to evaluate consumer risk and reputation from multi-chain financial transactions, consumer financial data, exchange liquidity, counterparty risks, and service platform reputation which are examples of risk management metrics that involve numerous judgments and qualitative assessments. This would allow consumers and service providers real-time reputation and risk data for automating authorization decisions for financial transactions including Lending, Borrowing, Repaying Debt, Depositing in Vaults/Pools, and much more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit Scores\r\nCredit Scores have been a cornerstone of risk evaluation in the global banking systems for decades. As such, it is one of the first use cases currently deployed in our offering. With this, DeFi protocols could use Chainscore to verify users’ eligibility based on a number of factors such as their past financial transactions, credit utilization, repayments, and credit age. Similarly, the consumer would have access to reputation scores for lending platforms, track record on their information-sharing practices and privacy practices, and third-party risk metrics (e.g. past security and privacy breach notifications, Dun and Bradstreet information, Better Business Bureau, and more).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would help to increase trust and reputation in financial transactions for DeFi and even in the metaverse.\r\n\r\nRisk Assessment\r\nIdentifying and analyzing potential risks that may negatively impact accounts, assets, and/or the application. Analyzing the risks with the probability of occurrence and severity of consequences value, we provide Risk Ratings which would be used by DeFi protocols to analyze a more complex range of assets such as DeFi Hedge Funds, Loan Pools, Assets, or just any applications/smart contracts in general.\r\n\r\nChainScore Network\r\nChainScore is powered by a decentralized network of data providers and oracle infrastructure. The Network provides an accessible, intuitive, and extensible interface for Financial Data Management and Risk Analytics through profound Scoring Algorithms and Machine Learning. Network services such as the Oracle Infrastructure, Keepers for automated smart contracts, and Encryption for preserving privacy could be used with it. \r\n\r\nWeb2 and Web3 Consumers could request credit risk data and analytics by sending requests through a Service Provider using their infrastructure or directly to our Network via our Chainscore client incentivized by $SCORE token.\r\n\r\nFeel

them?\r\n\r\nBillions of dollars worth of crypto assets have been made inaccessible and lost forever due to unexpected deaths and lost private keys.\r\n\r\nWith Will3, this can be avoided with 3 steps in around 5 minutes:\r\n\r\nApprove tokens / NFTs\r\nCreate Will3\r\nDone!\r\n\r\nWill3 solves this problem with a trustless, non-custodial solution that follows through with your wishes, ensuring nothing stands between your crypto assets (cryptocurrency, NFTs, ENS names) and your loved ones. We pride ourselves on strong and intuitive user experience through the Will3 website to set up your final wishes in as little as 5 minutes. Simply choose your beneficiaries through wallet address or ENS name, select what percentage of assets each beneficiary will receive, and upon death, the Will3 smart contract trustlessly disburses designated assets to chosen beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nThe Will3 team is comprised of Web3 builders with a decade of combined experience in building blockchain games, NFTs, and other dapps. They have led product development at companies including Apple, TD Ameritrade's blockchain R&D group, YCombinator startups and DreamWorks Animation.\r\n\r\nCurious how it works?

for the space inspired us to create this podcast focused on amplifying the values of decentralization, self-sovereignty and public goods that the web3 space espouses. We are especially focused on regenerative economics and NFTs for social justice and community building. \r\n\r\nWe began the podcast in July 2021 and have now published 32 episodes ranging from deep dives into critical philosophical concepts for understanding the crypto industry such as the definition of money to interviews with influencers in the NFT and regenerative economics space.\r\n\r\nWe will use the funding to cover expenses involved in making the podcast such as compensating our production engineer, as well as upgrade our production equipment to add video and publish our episodes to YouTube as well. We will also up our output from about 1 episode per week to 2-3 episodes per week.\r\n\r\nAfter attending ETH Denver 2022, we have a long list of amazing people to interview for the podcast over the next several months. We are thrilled to be working hard to share the positive side of crypto with the world. \r\n\r\nSome of our previous guests have been:\r\nDave Fortson, Director of Marketing, Regen Network\r\nThomas Morgan, Founder of BasinDAO\r\nBadiucao, Human rights activist and artist\r\n\r\nWe are grateful for any amount you can give so that we can continue to create valuable content for the web3 community

Pilot and Protocol Development","slug":"ecotoken-pilot-and-protocol-development","description":"The ecoToken System is a crowd funding platform for environmental regeneration projects. The system helps projects to create and then sell environmental credits. This process allows environmental technologies to gain funding and create a new revenue source and to give rewards back to those that funded their projects. With this grant funding we will be running two pilot projects to create environmental credit protocols that can easily be recreated everywhere. \r\n\r\nThe first project is developing a protocol for manure lagoon treatment. This protocol will create a new revenue model for future projects making them economically viable. This project should solve three major issues with manure on dairy farms:\r\n\r\n-GHG emissions from methane are much more damaging than CO2 emissions, this project should remove those gasses. \r\n-Manure odor is removed but the fertilizer remains. Moisture is removed from the manure leaving it odorless, but still very effective fertilizer that can easily be spread. \r\n-Ground water contamination is a major problem with these lagoons. When the dirty lagoons sit for too long the contaminants seep into the groundwater. By treating the water initially and maintaining this process we eliminate that issue. \r\n \r\nThis process has been successfully completed before with our partner NOAH Water Technologies. This project is to document the projects thoroughly and measure the environmental changes. Here, if you scroll down is an example of a previous lagoon project at the start, day 17, and day 24. This technology is low cost and highly scalable, so we believe that if we can create a replicable protocol we can scale significantly. \r\n\r\nOrganic Waste Runoff\r\nFor this project we are partnering with both NOAH Water Technologies and Harvest Recycling. We have not run this type of project before but we know that it is possible. We want to create a protocol to measure the amount of emissions we are reducing while documenting other environmental benefits. The aim of this is to treat the groundwater and create a system that can capture and treat runoff before it reaches underground aquifers. We believe that this is both possible and highly replicable with NOAHs low cost and portable technology. \r\n\r\nThe outcomes of this project will be:\r\n\r\n-Reduction in methane gas emissions from organic waste. \r\n-Reduced organics to landfill.\r\n-Creation of plant nutrient.\r\n-Elimination of odor.\r\n\r\nMore on Harvest Recycling:\r\nHarvest Recycling combines experience, innovation, and leading-edge technology to deliver flexible and cost-effective non-hazardous waste collection, recycling and landfill disposal services to customers in Calgary, Edmonton, and surrounding towns.\r\nHarvest Recycling facilities and operations have long been recognized as being amongst Alberta’s most environmentally responsible. We dedicate substantial investment and human resources to ensure that we are delivering the most innovative and sustainable solutions and the highest environmental standards. In 2012, we won the Calgary Green Company of the year award for providing the best services to our customers and the communities that we work with.\r\nOur Vision\r\nTo create a more sustainable environment for Alberta by diverting waste from landfills to our recycling facilities where they can be processed and converted for productive use.\r\nOur Mission\r\nHarvest Recycling is committed to delivering waste management services that improve the social, economic, and environmental well-being of Albertans. We are devoted to leading the industry by offering outstanding commercial and domestic waste collection services, recovery of recyclable material, and waste transportation and disposal services to enhance a sustainable future for our local communities. We do this by providing services that:\r\nMinimize waste\r\nMinimize the potential for an adverse environmental incident\r\nReduce greenhouse gases and other toxic emissions\r\nMinimize the environmental impact of waste transportation and disposal\r\nActively promotes recycling both internally and amongst our clients\r\nGenerate biomass products from organic waste\r\nMeet or exceed all relevant environmental legislation and bylaws in the areas that we operate\r\nMaintain a safe and high-quality working environment for our staff\r\n \r\nMore on the manure lagoon treatment:\r\nBiological matter stored in low oxygen environments always produces methane gas. Once emitted, methane stays in the atmosphere for about nine years, but its global warming potential is 86 times higher than carbon dioxide when averaged over 20 years and 28 times higher over 100 years.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, wastewater (sewage) and garbage combined comprise 12% of Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions. As we try to meet the UN targets for GHG reductions, this represents the low-hanging fruit.\r\nMost methods for reducing greenhouse gasses involve increasing the price of CO2 emissions, thus making the cost of doing business more expensive. NOAH systems, on the other hand, have cost savings for the user while improving the environment.\r\n\r\nGroundwater Contamination\r\n\r\nIn May 2000, a heavy rainstorm washed cattle manure into a town well in Walkerton, Ontario. The manure contaminated the water with the E.coli intestinal bacteria, causing illness and death. This was an extreme example of groundwater contamination that has been going on for decades, and it’s getting worse. Many people rely on wells for their potable water needs, but with increasing frequency, the water fails to meet minimal drinking water standards.\r\n\r\nAgriculture Odors\r\n\r\nAnyone living near an agricultural area or sewage treatment plant can attest to the pervasive smell that emanates from the operation. Besides being unpleasant, it bears eloquent testimony to the environmental harm being done.\r\n  \r\nThe ecoProject\r\n\r\nTreating Manure Using Natural Processes \r\n“The first thing you’ll notice is that the smell is gone,” is the way Jim Hay’s would introduce the HIOS system he designed to remediate manure lagoons. \r\nA Hays system features the HIOS suspension raft with dual oxygen jets circulators floating on the top of the lagoon. During a typical treatment, the first week will produce 4-6 inches of foam covering the lagoon as aerobic bacterial activity consumes the organic solids. \r\nFor the first 2-3 days, the odor increases and then becomes negligible as bacteria colonies thrive and multiply, doing their work fed by the super oxygenated water produced by the NOAH system. \r\n\r\nAfter four weeks, the lagoon becomes a nearly clear liquid able to digest all new manure coming into it in a matter of hours. \r\nThe water, now very high in nutrients, can be applied at any time of the year, even in the summer months, using standard irrigation systems. \r\nWhen the super-oxygenated, nutrient-rich water is applied to fields, it enriches the land, facilitating high-quality fodder production. \r\nGroundwater contamination from manure storage is an ongoing environmental concern affecting aquatic life and drinking water. A chemical analysis of the treated water highlights how effective our treatment is in restoring a healthy environment. \r\nThe manure system is typical of many green technologies, which can make

- a truly decentralised collab & participation protocol","slug":"cuppa-a-truly-decentralised-collab-participation-","description":"We're tackling DAO onboarding with a simple question - can we decentralise it?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're at such a powerful point in time. We have new forms of economic cooperation, and so many people in the world searching for a better way to work. We want to make it so work is wonderful.\r\n\r\nAfter all...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're starting with the question: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAOs are good at attracting people.  Tokenising communities allows permissionless participation at an economic level, but that's partial.  We can permissionless stake capital, but we can't permisisonlessly stake our effort.\r\n\r\nSo why do DAOs attract people but not keep them?  Why do they show up but not stick around?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause DAO processes treat people as economic inputs, not as people.  They're here to belong to a community!\r\n\r\nLet's try something different. After all, we can design and program our tokenised communities however we want, right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe power of cohorts comes from peer support\r\n\r\n\r\nMost education programs and startup accelerators work in cohorts because cohorts allow meaningful relationships to form, and groups onboard themselves much better when they know each other and can count on each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (We're seeing squad culture emerge in DAOs for this reason, because it creates safe spaces for orienting, learning and getting work done.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn web3, decentralised things move fast and freely.  Centralisation creates collusion and slows things down.\r\n\r\nIf we ask Vitalik about decentralisation, he says there are actually three kinds: architectural, logical and political. \r\n\r\nAnd if we look at typical DAO onboarding, like Discord flows, it's centralised on all three!  It's architecturally centralised on Discord servers.  it's politically centralised because the onboarding team decides how it works for everybody, and logically centralised because there's not freedom from that source of truth.  This makes it hard to keep up with all the stuff happening in the decentralised DAO!\r\n\r\nPOAP CHAINS ftw\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecentralised collaboration is ephemeral. People connect on common goals. Or just contribute where they add value. Why not let the work take it's own structure? Make contributing as easy as making tea!\r\n\r\nDecentralised access means letting members choose other members, and letting existing members form relationships with new joiners first.  We're seeing a few DAOs figuring this out - like how Gitcoin does group calls and one-on-one calls for new joiners.  It's all about being a guide, making intros, and being there for each other so we can all find our way.\r\n\r\nBut that approach isnt\\ not on-chain yet.  It still breaks because we use centralised access controls.\r\n\r\nThe answer is POAP CHAINING.  (For you crypto nerds, think about how trust chains work with certs and PGP.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTech level  - We're prototyping technical solutions including POAP wrappers and ERC1155 tokens.\r\n\r\nPeople level - We're also building out onboarding practices and formats that focus on trust-building, wayfinding and responsive education.\r\n\r\nWe're a Kernel KB5 group ourselves, a

- a researched guide to decentralised collaboration practices","slug":"daoistry-a-researched-guide-to-decentralised-coll","description":"Making DAOs nicer places to work, based on researched practices\r\nDesigning work environments in DAOs is hard! But it comes down to two questions: what do I need to understand? and what should I do next?  DAOistry tries to answer those questions based on either the most authorative sources, or practices that have a real track-record.  It takes big, complex ideas and boils them down to short explanations, simple guidance on when to choose which practices, and step-by-step formats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical help for building DAOs\r\n\r\nDAOistry is a little research project into what really works and doesn’t in decentralised communities.  I started it when learning about DAOs and web3 myself. I'm a maker (now a buidler) and I like coding up fun, little prototypes that help people.  I've also started a few community orgs (some decentralised) - but more on that later.  DAOistry is basically the result of trying to understand the challenges that DAOs face and the direction they're heading, so I could be a useful contributor.\r\n\r\nIt’s inspired by Arthur Clarke’s Profiles Of The Future - essays which explored the ultimate perimeters of what various scientific domains could discover. On one side we look at the long-term potential blockchain’s leaders see for humanity. Then we get practical, looking at what different DAOs are succeeding with today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new form of economic collaboration\r\nThere are plenty of gigabrains who have understood how powerful blockchains can be for society, and they've written a bunch of gigabrain papers about it. For us regular folks, those papers aren't so easy to read -- or even discover -- even though we know that DAOs are something new and powerful.\r\n\r\nOne half of DAOistry is about mindsets, where we've quoted directly from various blockchain thought leaders:\r\n\r\nThe Meaning Of Decentralisation by Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum)\r\nBulldozer vs Vetocracy Political Axis by Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum)\r\nBlockchain Affordances and the Invention of Future Milieus by Laura Lotti (Other Internet)\r\nMolochDAO Guide\r\nEconomic Productivity in Digital Media - OlympusDAO\r\nPolkadot Litepaper\r\n\r\nThese are boiled down to short posts, covering the big ideas we often hear in passing, but rarely see explained from the original sources.\r\n\r\nRead them at https://daoistry.com/mindsets\r\n\r\nSolid advice on the practices with track records\r\nTo keep it real (and not ape in to unfounded hype) we look at practices that are established enought to have a track record. This requires deep research and due diligence. Of course every DAO will hype themselves as masters of onboarding, vibes and conjurors of the best roadmaps. But we need to look deeper, see what practices really work, really stick and what trade-offs they surface.\r\n\r\nThis means researching beyond the blog posts and announcements, and tracking how practices evolve and adapt over months.\r\nAnd here are some of everyday practices we've drawn on so far:\r\n\r\nWhy the MakerDAO Forum Is the Heart of the Maker Community - MakerDAO\r\nUniswap Research Report: Discord, Governance, Community - Other Internet\r\nOwnership in Cryptonetworks - Curve Labs\r\nDecentralized Agile - Source Institute\r\nScaling Agile at Spotify - Kniberg & Ivarsson\r\nThe Basecamp Guide to Internal Communication - Basecamp\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again, we boil it down to more specific practices that you can apply.\r\n\r\nRead them at https://daoistry.com/practices\r\n\r\nHighlighting the DAO practices that work, in simple language.\r\n\r\nWe aim to make all this more accessible to you, the DAO contributor, who doesn’t have time to read all these papers and sift through all these forums. So we try to find the most meaningful examples, and write summaries.\r\n\r\nYour donation is used for... \r\nThis project is really just a labour of love. Writing it helps me crystalise my own understanding, which I do because I want to build tools that make work delightful in our new economy.But the real effect of this is when someone reads DAOistry, they fast-forward to understanding what to improve now, how to do it, and where they can aim long-term.\r\n\r\nYour funds will be used to hire coordinators to help me include more contributors. There are few people willing to volunteer to research and write, but the bottleneck is coordination.  Even small donations will help bring in paid coordinators, which will be the lynchpin to enabling all the writers. It'll also help kick off a forum for more discussion around the research (and exposing more of what's really working and why.)\r\n\r\nThis is some of our backlog - we've found really useful practices that will make life and work in DAOs way more pleasant if we can help share this know-how:\r\n\r\n More meeting formats like retrospectives, kick-offs\r\n Emergent (bottom-up) structures\r\n Schelling points\r\n Nash equilibria in committee decision-making\r\n Implicit and natural collusion\r\n Silos and departments\r\n Meme power\r\n Vibes\r\n Ways of preserving and developing organisational knowledge\r\n Information radiators\r\n Clearly defining different consensus mechanisms\r\n Cooperation games\r\n Crypto as a massive set of parallel experiments \"here we test in production ser\"\r\n Composability (for work coordination primitives)\r\n Compensation mechanisms\r\n\r\nWho’s behind this?\r\nHi I’m Sal. There’s a reason I’m bringing this approach to web3 communities.\r\n\r\nBack in 2009-2013, I ran a bunch of unconferences for founders who were developing the Lean Startup methodology. We ran it in 30 cities from San Francisco, to London, to Hanoi. Back then it was all founders (no corporate innovation) and all about practical stuff for launching software.\r\n\r\nLater, I did deep research on what startup mentoring practices worked best, which was used by the top-performing accelerators. From there, I got interested in new engineering solutions coming out of Sub-Saharan Africa. I interviewed 60 engineering tech founders about their challenges and solutions, which became the largest online tech entrepreneurship course in Africa at the time.\r\n\r\nSo you can see a thread here - I’m bringing the same no-nonsense approach to web3.

We believe in working with nature as a technology. 🌱\r\n\r\nBridging Web3 and Web🌳 \r\n\r\nImagine a world where we can archive our data in a way that leads to more trees being planted and helps remove CO2. This is the vision of Grow Your Own Cloud.\r\n\r\nOur technology and processes link the digital world with nature. This can create a rationale for the expansion of natural ecosystems. \r\n\r\nWe are using the power of Web3 to grow a global, decentralized organization. A community that can bring GYOC to the world to begin the development of what we call Web🌳. \r\n\r\nWhat we are Buidling\r\n\r\nURL, We are developing NFP.Garden - our first platform and product that brings GYOC's technology to the world. This is well underway as part of Seed Club #SC04 and will be announced soon (Follow Us!)\r\n\r\nIRL, We are currently developing the first prototype Data Forest in the Netherlands, undertaking economics and environmental impact assessments to model how our technology could change the paradigm of data storage, and bring nature back to urban spaces.\r\n\r\n \r\n How our Tech works\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe convert digital data (0s and 1s) into DNA (ATCG) and store strings of data in Plant DNA. To bring this into reality, we like to bring our science out of the lab.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, we developed the world’s first plant-based Data Centre - The Data Garden. This functional proof-of-concept enabled data to be stored and retrieved from plants and has won several international awards. \r\n\r\nWe also love to engage the public through experiences like pop-up Data Flower Shops in cities like Copenhagen and New York. \r\n\r\nWe are now in fundraising mode to further develop the technology, in particular:\r\n- Improve digital data storage capacity in organisms.\r\n- Expand the variety of organisms we can work with.\r\n- Develop environmental impact assessments.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is this important?\r\n\r\nThe Data Industry already contributes as much CO2 to the atmosphere as the aviation industry and consumes more than 2% of our energy. Emerging technologies will lead to this growing further. \r\n\r\nWe can develop technologies and processes that provide cleaner alternatives for data consumption and production. \r\n\r\nThrough DNA data storage we will be able to archive with negligible energy usage, and working with carbon absorbing organisms means we can provide carbon negative data storage. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy we are applying for a Grant\r\n\r\nThis round will go towards R&D into science and fund the development of our Web3 to Web🌳 bridge. \r\n\r\nWe have developed GYOC by growing as a community IRL from the ground-up. To date we have been 100% bootstrapped, growing slowly and supported generously by grants from individuals and bodies such as the EU. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the best way to develop and deploy our technology is through a permissionless, decentralized manner, leveraging the tools available in Web3 to help accelerate the development of our clean data technology. \r\n\r\nBy growing this community and leveraging the #DeSci ethos we will gain the expertise, commitment and resources required to make GYOC a scalable reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is Collaborative \r\n\r\n​​We are an award-winning, multi-disciplinary team developing cutting-edge research. Our work has been recognised by the United Nations and EU Starts Prize, presented at COP25 and the World Climate Summit 2019. In 2020 we were creative residents at Ginkgo Bioworks.🪴\r\n\r\nWe have already onboarded amazing partners in the synthetic biology space, with partners from University of Washington, Ginkgo Bioworks and MIT Media Lab supporting us. \r\n\r\nWithin the Web3 space we are part of Seed Club and finding allies with Polygon Studios to show that Green Blockchain offerings are possible.\r\n\r\nWe will be opening up our Call to Adventure to participants in the coming weeks and hope to on-board you soon!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Long-Term Vision\r\n\r\n\r\nOur vision is that we can enable a second stream of organic data archival - where energy hungry Data Farms will be replaced by carbon removing Data Forests. \r\n\r\nThis is a long-term, deep tech endeavour. It will take time. But we believe in bringing our technology to the world in incremental stages to bring awareness to the cause and demystify synthetic biology. \r\n\r\nWe will be launching our first steps to this long-term vision in Q2 2022, to accelerate the development of truly Green Data Storage. Developing simple solutions today will help power infrastructural change tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are a climate first initiative \r\n\r\nWe believe in an ecological and ethics first approach to developing technology. \r\n\r\nOur work is vital and carries a significant way to change the way the data we create impacts the environment. \r\n\r\nBy supporting GYOC you are supporting a future of clean data alternatives that aren’t just green, they’re carbon absorbing. \r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration. \r\nWe hope to grow our garden with your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@CyrusClarke\r\n@JeffNivala\r\n@SeyfriedMonika\r\n@EstelDuhart","reference_url":"https://growyourown.cloud/","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/4c1f2abc75db00db525a1b639004805d/GYOC_logo_full_color_RGB.jpeg","admin_address":"0xf75b89857cD1AED40F5B9Cf39994775de25aD1F5","amount_received":"2.0029","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-104798998,"related":[[12,5],[4093,2],[4883,2],[4938,2],[4924,2],[5386,2],[5245,2],[5090,2],[5082,2],[5040,2],[5033,2],[5008,2],[5005,2],[4981,2],[4913,2],[4740,1],[4098,1],[5369,1],[5367,1],[5352,1],[4932,1],[4929,1],[4927,1],[4926,1],[4922,1],[4896,1],[4889,1],[4882,1],[4878,1],[5435,1],[5427,1],[5422,1],[5409,1],[5399,1],[5296,1],[5290,1],[5288,1],[5272,1],[5268,1],[5257,1],[5248,1],[5241,1],[5237,1],[5236,1],[5224,1],[5215,1],[5214,1],[5205,1],[5191,1],[5189,1],[5184,1],[5164,1],[5155,1],[5148,1],[5140,1],[5138,1],[5137,1],[5135,1],[5134,1],[5130,1],[5129,1],[5119,1],[5118,1],[5117,1],[5092,1],[5091,1],[5084,1],[5081,1],[5041,1],[5039,1],[5035,1],[5027,1],[5025,1],[5023,1],[5017,1],[5016,1],[5007,1],[4998,1],[4977,1],[4975,1],[4972,1],[4964,1],[4953,1],[4949,1],[4945,1],[4939,1],[4920,1],[4919,1],[4914,1],[4898,1],[4875,1],[4874,1],[4866,1],[4863,1],[4861,1],[4857,1],[4846,1],[4840,1],[4836,1],[4832,1],[4830,1],[4827,1],[4816,1],[4804,1],[5468,1],[5426,1],[5372,1],[5371,1],[5334,1],[5332,1],[5318,1],[5316,1],[5222,1],[5211,1],[5198,1],[5178,1],[5158,1],[5132,1],[5108,1],[5106,1],[5098,1],[5093,1],[5062,1],[5045,1],[5037,1],[5031,1],[5029,1],[4944,1],[4943,1],[4923,1],[4912,1],[4905,1],[4897,1],[4885,1],[4879,1],[4500,1],[4349,1],[4335,1],[4327,1],[4097,1]],"upcoming":-100014000,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1648628871.789363,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1648663740.2273288,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1648663335.6085904},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":348785,"url":"/cyrusclarke","name":"cyb0rg","handle":"cyrusclarke","keywords":["Arduino","JavaScript","Python","Ruby","HTML","C#","Lua","C++","Jupyter Notebook","CSS","Processing","Shell"],"position":728,"followers":4,"following":4,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/b0fc23e78a670e2084ae9618e12a396a/cyrusclarke.png","github_url":"https://github.com/cyrusclarke","grants_owned":1,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":0},"team_members":[{"id":348785,"url":"/cyrusclarke","name":"cyb0rg","handle":"cyrusclarke","keywords":["Arduino","JavaScript","Python","Ruby","HTML","C#","Lua","C++","Jupyter Notebook","CSS","Processing","Shell"],"position":728,"followers":4,"following":4,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/b0fc23e78a670e2084ae9618e12a396a/cyrusclarke.png","github_url":"https://github.com/cyrusclarke","grants_owned":1,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":0},{"id":352591,"url":"/inter3stelar","name":"Inter3stelar","handle":"inter3stelar","keywords":[],"position":0,"followers":0,"following":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/c6baaf3fd602d3ad8e2453575cddf525/inter3stelar.png","github_url":"https://github.com/inter3stelar","grants_owned":0,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":0}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[1.0,0.2604761258628938,0.2604761258628938],[10.0,0.760454032254783,0.760454032254783],[100.0,1.9349576161730493,1.9349576161730493],[1000.0,3.782216502981292,3.782216502981292],[10000.0,5.417835373128921,5.417835373128921]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"2.0029","positive_round_contributor_count":2,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/4c1f2abc75db00db525a1b639004805d/GYOC_logo_full_color_RGB.jpeg"],"details_url":"/grants/5365/gyoc-bridging-web3-to-web"},{"id":5364,"active":true,"title":"DANK RANK","slug":"dank-rank","description":"DankRank is an ongoing meme competition.\r\n\r\nThe community choose whatever topics are important to them, and memers are rewarded for good memes.\r\n\r\nDecentralising agendas for creative work\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we're building this as a HYPERSTRUCTURE, an immutable PUBLIC GOOD designed to decentralise editorial agendas and bring joy to work in DAOs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're inspired by DeFi and AMM mechanics, applying the same style of match-making to content creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n☝️ Notice that points accrue to memers alone. This gives the creators alone the power to judge each others work.  (This will be important later.)\r\n\r\n👇🏽 Users can contribute to Memepools - Setting off a topic-based competition that Memers can battle on for a set period of time. 👇🏽\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n👇🏽 Memers receive NFT MINTS of their memes instantly, which DYNAMICALLY adjust in rank within their selected pools 👇🏽\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n👇🏽Tokens are redistributed in an ONGOING QUADRATIC BATTLE among the top meme submissions in each pool. 👇🏽\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeme freely\r\n\r\nInfluencing editorial agendas provides direct economic utility, because it drives creative work, like memes, to focus on a desired topic.  By separating the topic-setting agendas through pools, this allows memers freedom to do the work they believe in without compromise.  They're paid based on the ratings of their peers.  We believe this is a positive step and a balanced approach to censorship resistance.\r\n\r\nEMISSIONS favour people who submit more, so memers build up voting power over time.\r\n\r\nWhales can influence the popularity of topics, but never buy their way onto the leaderboard.\r\n\r\nContent creators are rewarded with voting power, not the people who set topics.  This prevents editorial control from being used as vetocratic censoring of the creative work itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning meming into an infinite game\r\n\r\n\r\ncontract DankRank is ERC1155, IERC1155Receiver \r\n\r\nsubmit( string calldata url) public returns (uint256) // submit a link to your meme, get an NFT back \r\nstake(uint targetId, uint amount) public // stake your points on a submission \r\njudge() public // judge the tokens and redistribute points \r\ngetUrl(uint256 id) public view returns (string memory) // what's the link for the gif? \r\ngetPlace(uint256 id) public view returns (uint ) // what's the current NFT rank? \r\nepoque() public view returns (uint256 ) // group submissions in time-blocks\r\n\r\ntldr;  this code is a new type of NFT called an ERC1155 multitoken - it combines the DANK points with the NFT submissions in one place.

Each C-Voxel has your work data tied to your transfer transaction hash on any chain. It can be generated on Ceramic Network by very simple steps with NO FEES.\r\nYou can stack your C-Voxels and they become your own on-chain work history / verifiable credentials.\r\nFurthermore, You can easily share your C-Voxels to any DAOs and platforms on Web3.0.\r\n\r\nCurrently, C-Voxel is running on a testnet as alpha version. Release on the main net is scheduled for 2Q2022.\r\nhttps://testnet.cvoxel.xyz/intro\r\n\r\nC-Voxel Visualization\r\n\r\nYou can see your C-Voxel collection like this:\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecification\r\n\r\nC-Voxel visualization protocol is:\r\n\r\n\r\nWork data, that is associated with your each transfer Transaction hash, has these properties below.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Generate C-Voxel?\r\n\r\nYou can issue your C-Voxel by executing really easy steps.\r\nAdd your work summary to your existing transaction on C-Voxel App and claim it with signature. At the time, a Semi C-Voxel will be created.\r\nJust Ask for a sign to payer of the transaction via discord, e-mail and twitter etc...\r\nThat’s it! Once the payer signs, you get your own C-Voxel!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\nC-Voxel generates a decentralized user-owned online CVs on the Ceramic Network, which is one of the greatest decentralized data network.\r\nThis protocol is part of verifiable credentials and forms a decentralized identification. Each job details are tied to on-chain transactions and stored with the signatures of both the payee and the payer.\r\n\r\nC-Voxel is open and platform independent, allowing users to take it with them wherever they go.\r\nIn addition, in the future the generated CVoxel can be minted as NFT on various on-chains (we plan to deploy NFT function on ETH L2 at first.).\r\nFurthermore, development is underway for integration with distributed DB, which will make the VC protocol even more useful and cooperative.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we will expand C-Voxel ecosystem by developing products based on C-Voxel such as identification and recruiting tools for DAOs, and credit provision services.\r\n\r\nFor more details, Please check our documentation.\r\nhttps://docs.cvoxel.xyz/\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere my contribution go?\r\n\r\nWe would like to use your donations to accelerate C-Voxel development, expand the community,  and promotion.\r\nYour contribution will build the great protocol which makes it easier to work and to find the skills you need in the coming Web 3.0.\r\nWe would be very happy if you would try our product( https://testnet.cvoxel.xyz/intro ). \r\nAlso If you are interested in CVoxel, feel free to join us on Discord( https://discord.gg/HqjQPfjZ ) anytime!\r\n\r\nRoadmap 2022\r\nQ1\r\nTestnet Go Live: (Current C-Voxel app is still alpha version)\r\nQ2\r\nLaunch on

matches Ukrainian refugees with jobs globally.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n2.5 million Ukrainians have fled the war as refugees, and many more are expected to follow.  The long-term financial requirements of these displaced peoples will be significant.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ukraine has a highly educated population, with a significant IT industry and qualified professionals across many other industries.  The refugee community has valuable technical and other skills that could continue to generate them an income.\r\n\r\nIt is the goal of RemoteUkraine.org to enable every skilled Ukrainian refugee to continue earning a living, irrespective of their current location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n> Empower Ukrainian refugees to continue to live in dignity and remain financially independent by using their valuable skills to earn a living.\r\n> Reduce the financial burdens of countries in hosting Ukrainian refugees.\r\n> Increase the positive perceptions of local communities hosting Ukrainian refugees.\r\n\r\nMOTIVATION\r\nThe platform is powered by TalentPools.io.  Our CTO is Igor who is Ukrainian and based in Ukraine. The suddenness of his plight during these first days of the war, and the severity of the situation his family and friends are still experiencing, has inspired our team to contribute however we can. \r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS\r\nWorkers can create their profile, and businesses can post their jobs. The platform creates the matches and makes the introductions. Of course, as a non-profit initiative it's all totally free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS\r\nTwo weeks after launching, there are 3,000+ registered refugees, 750+ jobs and hundreds of matches.  We've been covered in CNBC, Sifted and other media.\r\n\r\nNEXT STEPS\r\nWith over 2.5 million refugees, there are a lot of workers looking for jobs and we'll continue to support more refugees and businesses to use the platform. Igor and our other developers are adding new features fast, despite being interrupted every few hours with air-raid sirens!\r\n\r\nFUNDING\r\nSo far, the project has been funded by an individual to get up and running.

a galaxy far, far away...\r\n\r\nEvery year, thousands of kids begin their crypto Jedi Training. They begin their journey as curious and ambitious Padawans. Under the guidance of the Jedi Order, they visit faraway worlds completing missions along the way (hackathons), and having awesome Jedis (mentors) to guide them along their journey!\r\n\r\nBy the end of their journeys, they become Jedis.\r\n\r\nWe’re here to bring that galaxy right here!\r\n\r\nWhat We Do\r\nWe’re the youth talent incubator of crypto - to onboard thousands of talented kids into crypto! We send them to conferences to hack, get cryptopilled, then join a community of fellow Padawans. Depending on their interests, they’re placed into cohorts who will either focus on founding companies, contributing to protocols, or just learn about different crypto verticals in general! We find the mentors and resources to help them become Jedi!\r\n\r\nThanks to the community we’ve had awesome support! From generous individuals who’ve sponsored kids to go to those conferences to Jedis who’ve volunteered their time to help us build out this DAO and help out Padawans!\r\n\r\nOur goal by the end of this year is to onboard 1000 Padawans into crypto. And to achieve that vision...\r\n\r\nWe Need Your Help\r\nFunding is our current biggest bottleneck. We’ve been able to raise a lot of money from generous individuals like yourself! But we need a lot more money to reach out goal - and Gitcoin is the perfect place for that!\r\n\r\nDepending on the event, it can cost anywhere from 1500 to 2500 USD per Padawan → For this round we would love to raise 100K+ to send 50 padawans to DevConnect in April!\r\n\r\nOur Past Record\r\nWe have funded:\r\n18 people to ETHLisbon\r\n13 people to DCentral Miami\r\n46 people to ETHDenver\r\n10 people to ETHRio\r\nSome Padawan Hackathon Results!\r\nETHLisbon Top 10 & 1st Aave Grant\r\nWinner ETHDenver MetaCartel Pitch Competition\r\nETHDenver Harmony + Opolis & Superfluid Bounty Winners\r\nETHDenver Top 30 & Vitalik’s Choice Award\r\nOur Supporters\r\nvitalik.eth -

We plan to use the structure of a DAO to truly decentralize the growing phenomena of working from anywhere. “How?” you might ask. \r\n\r\nLong term: By buying real estate in locations such as the Caribbean, Northern California, and The Mediterranean as well as other hotspots and turning them into decentralized UNcorporate housing. This is a timeshare as a public good. As Landed will work to create regenerative value for the locality in which each living space is located. Value in the form of gardens, and small scale farming where possible, identification of and collaboration (or funding) with local organizations and community leaders who are doing good in the the community.\r\n\r\nShort Term: By partnering with owners who are already on platforms like Airbnb and securing enjoyable and beautiful spaces for our digital nomad, or Temporary Resident, \r\nthe Landed DAO member\r\n\r\nBetter than a timeshare or Airbnb, members of Landed will be able to book and block off time to live in these spaces while maintaining privacy and connection to other members when they choose.\r\n\r\nModern Nomadic Living, Not Vacationing. Landed DAO wants to facilitate the nomad, the wanderer but that is different from vacationing. We expect members to enjoy being able provide to the space. Whether that be in the form of knowledge for the community, garden assistance, technical or physical stewardship. \r\n\r\n\r\nPROBLEM:\r\n\r\nSo many people during the pandemic realized in almost existensial ways that they were living in unsustainable ways, working too much, commuting for no reason, and living lives of which not much exploration was present. We all know many people did not have the option of working from home and now that many people do, or are still creating lifestyles to be able to work from home; a lot of us are seeking more nomadic ways of life. \r\n\r\nLack of community and support, and oftentimes undesirability or prohibitive costs of things like AirBnB, corporate housing, couch surfing, and WOOFing are deterring many people from living the nomadic lifestyles they’d like to choose. \r\n\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nBeing a member of a community where you are rewarded for your nomadic desires and personal skillset through creating digital and physical assets and being granted access to a personal or shared living space for extended periods of time. Membership should be expected to grant different things at different levels, with voting on what types of regenerative initiatives, crops and attributes endow new spaces we look to acquire on certain levels, and various extended stays in the living spaces themselves at others as well as fractional ownership of properties. We aim to collaborate with other DAOs to help decentralize the design and upkeep of each space and are in talks with Opera Sneaker DAO about art curation and hope to collaborate with Pizza DAO on providing pizza in some manner.","reference_url":"https://www.figma.com/file/ZfNNqIKr7KNeebevMPQAiE/Landed-DAO---Anbessa-Tiwoni?node-id=1%3A2","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/cad36c41205f76b6688fd6ec82a58a8f/Landed_Dao_3_-2.png","admin_address":"0x02c09fDddda54A9B15D420495fE91c9ac4D4c431","amount_received":"66.1208","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any

- enabling simple and efficient carbon offsetting","slug":"atem-enabling-simple-and-efficient-carbon-offsett","description":"Hey there! Thanks for stopping by and considering to support Atem - we hope to give you a good idea of our work below, and feel free to join our Discord to learn more or get in touch!\r\n\r\n💡 What is Atem?\r\n\r\nAtem is a simple and efficient interface for companies to offset their carbon footprint via on-chain carbon credits. Think of it like this: Where Toucan is the on-ramp for carbon credits, Atem is the off-ramp - ensuring that offsetting demand is connected to Web3.\r\n\r\n🎯 Why are we building it? \r\n\r\nThere is no question what we need to do to combat climate change: Reduce carbon emissions and offset those we can not avoid. For the latter we already have an economic instrument in place - carbon offsets. But the carbon offset markets are broken in their current form, because they are fragmented, intransparent and inefficient.\r\n\r\nWeb3 infrastructure potentially solves this, as we go from fragmented and intransparent to connected and transparent via shared ledgers and verifiable, public data. And while the market has started moving on-chain, it remains inaccessible for everyone but the crypto-savvy. \r\n\r\nWith Atem, we aim to change this and enable convenient, fiat-based access to the on-chain carbon market for corporates wanting to offset their emissions and other large-scale buyers of carbon credits. \r\n\r\n🏗 What have we achieved so far?\r\n\r\nOur journey began in January of this year, so it's early days for Atem and we've made good progress, most importantly:\r\n\r\n* Building the technological foundation to execute large offsetting orders - e.g. our own sub-graph to filter available credit supply and smart contract to buy and redeem credits in one transaction, accounting for fees and price volatility\r\n\r\n* Reaching out to more than 50 potential customers and closing first offsetting deals, leading to our first order being executed a few days ago and many more to come\r\n\r\n* Most importantly, building a small, passionate and experienced core team to lay the foundations for Atem based on which we can invite more contributors and the wider ReFi community to join \r\n\r\n✌ Meet the team\r\n\r\nMattes - led the engineering team at award-winning classical music streaming service IDAGIO\r\nAlex - co-founder of Ape Unit, active in Web3 since 2017 with projects like Dacade\r\nPeik - worked in business development at Enpal, chairman of a non-profit supporting SDG’s in Kenya\r\nChristoph -  co-founder of IDAGIO and member of Leaders for Climate Action \r\n\r\n🤝 What are we using the funds for?\r\n\r\nAtem is entirely bootstrapped (for now) and we'll use the funds to pay for expenses (e.g. setting up the legal entity for Atem) and freelancers that will help us execute faster (e.g. with frontend development). \r\n\r\n💚 Much love from the Atem team for considering and supporting us - please do reach out to learn more and we hope to see you around!\r\n\r\n\r\n","reference_url":"https://www.atem.green/","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/a82eef3b0f2cd157a871a7201d688630/MacBook_Pro_-_20_1.jpg","admin_address":"0x49971886c6482E6387F2A408CBE1b226B4532EB5","amount_received":"12.5623","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any

DAO - Decentralized Ecosystem Protection and Regeneration","slug":"ecorise-dao-decentralized-ecosystem-protection-an","description":"Welcome to ECORISE!\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThe problem is:\r\n \r\nWe are fostering the sixth mass extinction in our lifetimes due to unintentional consumerism. While our day to day lifestyles support extraction based businesses our ecosystems suffer as a result. It is time to take responsibility and proceed with the intention to manage our ecosystems in an ecological and sustainable manner.\r\n \r\nOur Solution:\r\n \r\nIntroducing ECORISE, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).\r\nThe purpose of ECORISE is to aggregate all organizations and businesses together who are focused on planetary conservation through protection, sustainability and regeneration.\r\nThese focal groups become members of the DAO, a decentralized hub for global ecological governance. Collectively these groups can now share vast amounts of pertinent data between each other. Artificial Intelligence is applied to create standardized subsets of carbon markets and pricing and thus the carbon and co-benefit markets become streamlined.\r\nThe DAO connects Nonprofits and Conservation Groups with Donors and For-Profits with Capital, Partners and stakeholders.\r\n \r\nECORISE created a two token ecosystem to protect planetary ecosystems.\r\n\r\nECO, a Land-pegged stable token balanced by RISE, a deflationary utility token used for conservation and ecological sustainability.\r\n \r\nRISE is the oil that lubricates the system. It is the Utility token and is used for governance, voting and staking into the DAO. RISE also helps ECO keep its peg through a process called seigniorage. RISE is also used to purchase NFTs from the DAO.\r\n \r\nEssentially, your NFTs are a way of “adopting” ecosystems and animals in those ecosystems. Through continuous protection and preservation, these ecosystems generate revenue either through tourism and / or carbon credits and other co-benefits through Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES). Just the market for CARBON CREDITS will potentially be 4 to 10x in the next 10 years so the upside investment potential in Ecosystem Service is huge. This is a growing movement and we expect to see these terms explode in popularity.\r\n \r\nECORISE has created a fully functional Economic Model that allows for Ecological Ecosystem Economics, you are incentivized and rewarded for protecting, conserving and regenerating the planet’s ecosystems.\r\nFinally, we have a blockchain project that focuses on ESG goals and especially environmental impact, arguably the most important issue of our time.\r\n\r\nFunds obtained through this Gitcoin round will go towards marketing and development.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack End Development by Ubik Group

Charities to NFTs","slug":"connecting-charities-to-nfts","description":"About us\r\nBased in New Zealand, Digital Charity Art (DCA) is a non-profit leveraging web3 technologies to drive funding & awareness for charitable ventures, with the ultimate vision of becoming the refi hub of NFT philanthropy. Proceeds from DCA’s NFT collections support causes such as ocean conservation, deforestation and mental health, and they are aiming to raise funding in this Grant round to support expansion, marketing, and operations into 2022.\r\n\r\n\tThe DCA team\r\nDCA consists of a core team of three New Zealander's, Josh, Grace, and Jarden, with a collective experience of 12 years in the cryptocurrency and NFT spaces. The Project Manager Josh is an Officer in the New Zealand Army, with 7 years of Leadership and Project Management experience, Grace, is a digital art and website designer with a Masters in Psychology and a passion for NFT generative art, & Jarden is a PhD ecologist with a network of connections within New Zealand's philanthropic organizations.\r\n\r\n\tOur history and services\r\nDCA has launched two modest scale projects already, Digital Oceans V1 and V2, and worked tirelessly to build a reputation as a trusted, professional team with a genuine commitment to empowering charities. DCA has already formed a network of official charity partnerships in the ocean conservation space, including: See Turtles, World Wildlife Fund, Sea Shepherd, Oceanic Society and Marine Megafauna Foundation. \r\n\r\nThe services DCA provides to charities includes:\r\nDirect donations.\r\nDriving awareness to their causes or objectives.\r\nPurchasing merchandise and Eco-tourism trips from partnered charities.\r\nIncentivizing activities in the DCA community that align with charity outputs/requirements.\r\nConnecting skilled community members to charities to fill vacancies and demands they need.\r\n\r\n\tOur business model in brief\r\nDCA intends to conduct these activities while using a novel \"Proof of Time\" NFT mechanism, where their business model revolves around the use of staking rewards to fund operations. This approach has already been explored with KlimaDAO, who DCA are officially partnered with. \r\n\r\n\tIn closing\r\nDriving awareness for charitable ventures is incredibly difficult, particularly with current market conditions. Therefore DCA is aiming to raise funding to support operations into Q2, resource meaningful marketing efforts, and develop a network of professional advisors.\r\n\r\nAll links are here, the DCA team are always happy to answer any questions & any support is appreciated.\r\n\r\nNgā mihi nui\r\n\r\nJosh\r\nProject Manager, Digital Charity Art","reference_url":"https://www.digitalcharityart.co.nz/","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/2f10d9828d17ff6701dd4cc62e2068b5/Banner.JPG","admin_address":"0xE4676b9F786535597f1a3890F9362e7499f5dEe0","amount_received":"0.0000","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-105400000,"upcoming":-100018000,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1648663739.9557965,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1648663338.9273145},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":351217,"url":"/samuraiturtle","name":"SamuraiTurtle","handle":"samuraiturtle","keywords":[],"position":0,"followers":0,"following":1,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/9f40d3a6589ad0a4e616d70685a47865/samuraiturtle.png","github_url":"https://github.com/samuraiturtle","grants_owned":1,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":0},"team_members":[{"id":351217,"url":"/samuraiturtle","name":"SamuraiTurtle","handle":"samuraiturtle","keywords":[],"position":0,"followers":0,"following":1,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/9f40d3a6589ad0a4e616d70685a47865/samuraiturtle.png","github_url":"https://github.com/samuraiturtle","grants_owned":1,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":0}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"0.0000","positive_round_contributor_count":0,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/2f10d9828d17ff6701dd4cc62e2068b5/Banner.JPG"],"details_url":"/grants/5330/connecting-charities-to-nfts"},{"id":5329,"active":true,"title":"DAO Brussels","slug":"dao-brussels","description":"Hi, we’re DAO Brussels 👋\r\n\r\nOur goal is to be the friendly face of crypto in Brussels.\r\n\r\nThat’s right, the city with the peeing statue 😎\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy should you care about us?\r\nWe are a close-knit yet approachable community of 300 citizens strong.\r\nWe bring people together to learn about crypto.\r\nWe organise regular in-person and online events with a personal touch.\r\nWe encourage citizens to join DAOs or start their own project. #BUIDL\r\nAll European decision makers visit Brussels regularly. We have the unique opportunity to show them, their assistants, their friends, their families… the benefits of crypto and web3. The more they experience crypto and understand it, the more likely we will have crypto-friendly regulations in Europe.\r\nWe have the best fries in the world wait, that’s not relevant to the visitors of Gitcoin…\r\n\r\nThis is one of the events we did last February:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUh1xhM0yKc\r\n\r\nWe don’t expect you to watch the whole video :) Here are some pictures of our March event:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole gathering was run by volunteers and gratis to attend! It’s local sessions like these, where newbies learn from passionate degens, where co-founders band together, where developers write their first smart contract, where friendships are built, where everyone is welcome 💖\r\n\r\nSo far we have organised 7 events like this, and we are stoked to organise at least one every month until the inevitable HEAT DEATH. OF. THE. UNIVERSEEEE. 🔥\r\n\r\nWhat else does DAO Brussels do?\r\nWe organise crypto co-working every Friday to foster collaboration and cross-pollination.\r\nWe organised a Solarpunk NFT contest: https://www.imagine.brussels/en/contest/\r\nWe participate in hackathons, such as DAO Hack by Encode and BitDAO, to develop our DAO and build tools for the community.\r\nWe connect crypto businesses with skilled individuals in our Discord, so both can grow.\r\nWe will visit Devconnect Amsterdam to meet and collaborate with the global crypto community.\r\nWe share the knowledge of our speakers on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClgbKT6NhY2Au6xn_TquBYg\r\nWe write a newsletter every month with updates from the local crypto community, subscribe here: https://dao.brussels/\r\nWe tweet: https://twitter.com/daobrussels\r\n\r\nWhy do we apply for funding?\r\nWe are all volunteers and up to this point we’ve been operating with near-zero funding. We love what we do, but we realise that compensating our members for their time would significantly increase the growth of our DAO. For one, it would incentivize people to participate more, which creates a stronger community. Our contributors would be able to dedicate more time to improve the DAO, which means we can onboard more citizens, reach out to more politicians, guide more people towards a job in web3 and start more decentralised and self-organising initiatives.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to become self-sustainable, meaning we want to provide valuable crypto-related services and products to our community at a democratic price. The money will be used to fuel the growth of our DAO.\r\n\r\nBy donating to this grant, you can help bootstrap this process. Even a small amount helps!\r\n\r\nWe are a localised initiative, so we can show the relevancy of web3 to people where they live, work, eat and play. We hope that soon initiatives like ours will emerge in every major city of Europe and the world. Imagine how strongly that would anchor crypto in our society and make it more free, decentralised, permissionless and self-organising.\r\n\r\nWhat does DAO Brussels want to accomplish in the next 6 months?\r\nKeep organising beginner-friendly events to onboard more people.\r\nBuild our documentation and improve the processes for proposals, onboarding, the allocation of funds, roles, responsibilities, voting…\r\nPut the A in DAO: choose or build tooling to automate our processes.\r\nBuild income streams to make our DAO self-sustainable.\r\nSupport artists to create their first NFT project.\r\nBuild a legal team that works together with politicians to provide more regulatory clarity and assurances for the crypto industry in Belgium and Europe.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with any of these goals, please donate a large, medium or small amount to this grant. We highly appreciate that you enable us to carry out our mission!","reference_url":"https://dao.brussels","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/24f3dad815383ad01a8c1bb5c4104b5a/DAO.Brussels_-_Official_logo_by_Studio_Coste_large.png","admin_address":"0x5aA04091296690b6Ae1Bb37286034FFD5405c146","amount_received":"396.3133","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any

Kitchen - unique and innovative protocols for creators on the Algorand blockchain","slug":"the-kitchen-unique-and-innovative-protocols-for-c","description":"Innovative contracts for creators - NFT wrapping, slicing, escrow, staking and lotteries. Use “in-house” or white label on your own dApp or website. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is this dApp being created?\r\nAt the heart of blockchain technology is the concept of decentralization – where no one party has ultimate control and where consensus between many parties is how decisions are reached. The Algorand blockchain is still relatively juvenile – having only been in existing for 3 years at time of publication. Due to this, many dApps – specifically, but not limited to, NFT marketplaces – are relatively centralized – where the dApp creator, website admin or development team still hold the majority of control over the use and function of the smart contracts therein. \r\nThe Kitchen aims to provide tools to creators and users alike to increase the decentralization of the Algorand blockchain ecosystem by providing a permissionless dApp, hosted by the development team and providing all protocols in white label versions for creators to take advantage of.\r\n\r\nAims\r\nProvide creators on the Algorand blockchain with access to novel smart contracts in white label form.\r\nProvide general users with access to novel smart contract and decentralized finance (DeFi) to enrich their portfolios and use of the blockchain.\r\nTo increase the overall decentralization of the Algorand blockchain.\r\n\r\nCore Smart Contracts\r\nAt the heart of The Kitchen are our smart contract protocols:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hibachi protocol is an Algorand Standard Asset (ASA) staking contract which allows the deployer of the contract to determine the staking ASA and the reward ASA. Users will be rewarded on an hourly basis and can redeem and restake those rewards back into the protocol which will compound with their original stake. Users are free to remove their stake at any time.\r\nThe in-house version of this protocol will allow any user of the dApp to create their own staking and reward pool, deploy it to our website and allow other users to take advantage of it. Rewards and minimum contract balance in $ALGO must be supplied by the deployer of the contract.\r\nThe white label version of this contract provides creators with the contract code, programmed in Reach and a basic, customisable, front-end programmed in React.js. They will also be provided with general usage and maintenance instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plastic wrap protocol brings NFT wrapping to Algorand. Users deposit their NFT in a smart contract which is unique to them and in return they receive a wrapped version representing their original NFT. Users can upload alternative artwork to use for the wrapped NFT or take advantage of the default \"shrink wrapped\" style. Original NFTs can be retrieved by sending the wrapped NFT back to the contract.\r\nThe contract can wrap multiple unique NFTs allowing the user to use the protocol like a vault if they wish. The in-house version of the protocol on the-kitchen.io allows for NFT wrapping for a small transaction fee. \r\nNFT wrapping is not just for vaults however - creators can use the plastic wrap protocol to wrap their NFTs prior to releasing in a shuffle - providing an effective \"anti-peek\" mechanism. The plastic wrap protocol can be combined with any other protocols in the Kitchen such as Salami, Trifle and Fridge.\r\nThe white label version of this contract provides creators with the contract code, programmed in Reach and a basic, customisable, front-end programmed in React.js. They will also be provided with general usage and maintenance instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth the Salami and Mortadella protocols relate to dividing NFTs into multiple parts – these parts are themselves newly minted NFTs. Each instance of the contract is deployed by one user – each instance can “slice” many NFTs and hold the original assets. This means that each user can have their own instance of each contract, specific to them, which holds their original NFTs.\r\nWith Salami the deployer can specify, per NFT, how many equal portions they wish it to be split into. These portions are returned to the user while the original NFT is held within the contract. The user is free to distribute, sell or otherwise use the portions how they wish. To retrieve the original NFT from the contract all portioned NFTs must be returned.\r\nIn the Mortadella protocol, a very similar logic to Salami is used, however the portions do not have to be equal in size. Again, as with Salami, all portions of the NFT must be returned to retrieve the original NFT.\r\nThe in-house version of this protocol will allow any user of the dApp to slice their NFTs into the portions with sizes and amounts at their discretion.\r\nThe white label version of this contract provides creators with the contract code, programmed in Reach and a basic, customisable, front-end programmed in React.js. They will also be provided with general usage and maintenance instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Smoothie protocol is one of the few non-NFT related protocols within The Kitchen. Smoothie is used to create non-lossless lotteries by enabling users to sell tickets and produce a winner at draw time that wins the pot. The amount of the pot taken by the contract creator is customisable.\r\nThe in-house version of the protocol will be one main lottery hosted on The Kitchen, with draws taking place weekly. 5% of the pot goes back into The Kitchen for re-investment.\r\nThe white label version of this contract provides creators with the contract code, programmed in Reach and a basic, customisable, front-end programmed in React.js. They will also be provided with general usage and maintenance instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trifle protocol is specific for creators and sellers of NFTs who want to offer bundling of various assets into one package. This package can contain multiple NFTs as well as standard ASAs. Users will send the NFTs to be bundled to the contract and they will be returned a newly minted NFT which represents the bundle. To \"open\" the bundle, users send it back to the contract and receive the bundled assets in their original form.\r\nThis protocol can be combined with other protocols in The Kitchen, including Salami and Plastic Wrap.\r\nThe white label version of this contract provides creators with the contract code, programmed in Reach and a basic, customisable, front-end programmed in React.js. They will also be provided with general usage and maintenance instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fridge protocol allows NFT creators to facilitate asynchronous rewards for their holders. Rewards are placed into the contract with the NFT collection or creation address needed to unlock the rewards specified at deployment. Creators can specify an expiry date for rewards, which, if reached, will return any unclaimed rewards back to the creator.\r\nDue to the nature of the protocol, no in-house version will exist initially however it may be used in the future.\r\nThe white label version of this contract provides creators with the contract code, programmed in Reach and a basic, customisable, front-end programmed in React.js. They will also be provided with general usage and maintenance instructions.\r\n\r\nGrant usage\r\n\r\nA grant would allow me - the founder and currently sole developer - to purchase and maintain servers, pay for contracted artwork for specific parts of the site and marketing. The vision is to get the site to a point where it sustains itself and eventually turn a profit through transaction fees when users partake in any of the protocols. \r\n\r\nOne thing that is important however is that we will be releasing white label versions of each protocol in addition to providing the smart contract code as open source on GitHub. White labelling will allow creators to implement the protocols on their own sites which will help to grow the overall Algorand ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAll contracts are written in Reach with the front end in React.js.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reference_url":"https://the-kitchen.io","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/22aa95d65c5cff3498904d9697ef2a30/main-logo3.png","admin_address":"0x0","amount_received":"1.9395","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-105399998,"related":[[4529,2],[5463,2],[5404,2],[5293,2],[5311,2],[5305,2],[5201,2],[5244,2],[4526,1],[4535,1],[5309,1],[5303,1],[5275,1],[5291,1],[4620,1],[4524,1],[4527,1],[5301,1]],"upcoming":-100017000,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1648628914.8725543,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1648663337.0417452,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1648663337.0536623},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":350590,"url":"/xxiled-plastic-cat","name":"Xxiled","handle":"xxiled-plastic-cat","keywords":["JavaScript","RenderScript"],"position":736,"followers":8,"following":8,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/0b754e60cd0cfb88d88aee566b9fb036/xxiled-plastic-cat.png","github_url":"https://github.com/xxiled-plastic-cat","grants_owned":1,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":5},"team_members":[{"id":350590,"url":"/xxiled-plastic-cat","name":"Xxiled","handle":"xxiled-plastic-cat","keywords":["JavaScript","RenderScript"],"position":736,"followers":8,"following":8,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/0b754e60cd0cfb88d88aee566b9fb036/xxiled-plastic-cat.png","github_url":"https://github.com/xxiled-plastic-cat","grants_owned":1,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":5}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"1.9395","positive_round_contributor_count":2,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/22aa95d65c5cff3498904d9697ef2a30/main-logo3.png"],"details_url":"/grants/5323/the-kitchen-unique-and-innovative-protocols-for-c"},{"id":5321,"active":true,"title":"Healthcare Innovation is Broken (We’re Fixing It)","slug":"healthcare-innovation-is-broken-were-fixing-it","description":"Healthcare is a mess. It's an expensive, miserable experience for patients and often focuses on solving the wrong problem. Design-Inspired Healthcare aims to empower the people who want to change the system—healthcare practitioners (HCPs)—with the knowledge, network and funding to realize truly innovative solutions to help their patients. \r\n\r\nAbout\r\nTrue innovation in healthcare needs three key ingredients: the right people, at the right time, with enough funding to test their idea. The Design-Inspired Healthcare grant will bring all these together as part of an existing 7-week workshop and existing community. The impact of this grant will be massive, giving teams agency and the opportunity to be change agents in healthcare, not simply accepting a broken system.   \r\n\r\nIsn’t there already funding for this stuff?\r\nNo. Clinicians with a good problem to solve have zero funding at the start. Many talk about the “Valley of Death” for startups during their critical early fundraising phase, but just as important is the first dollar put towards testing their idea. The Design-Inspired Healthcare grant will be the first money in, competitively awarded to ideas vetted through Design-Inspired Healthcare workshop and enabling teams to gain traction and secure additional funds. \r\n\r\nHow does this relate to GitCoin?\r\nLet’s face it, adoption of blockchain solutions in healthcare is still very early. Design-Inspired Healthcare is about identifying the most important problems to solve for clinicians that aren’t immediately financially viable for traditional investment metrics. Nurturing and facilitating an entrepreneurial ecosystem around solving healthcare challenges is a public good that is often overlooked or inconsistently funded by government agencies. While we will be delighted if the teams find blockchain to be an appropriate solution to their problem, it will not be a requirement. At minimum, each clinical team will need to learn how to set up a wallet, receive and deploy funds to further their mission. This activity will create positive adoption of Ethereum technology for a public good among mission-driven healthcare teams who wouldn’t otherwise engage with it.   \r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\nThe proposed grant would provide the following:\r\nA matching grant pool of $80k to be awarded to the Spring 2022 cohort of clinician-led teams. Teams would be required meet two criteria for the grant:\r\nComplete the Design-Inspired Healthcare workshop starting April 20th, 2022 with final pitches on June 1, 2022. \r\nTeams must apply for a $20k Flash Grant from the NC Biotechnology Center, or equivalent grant funding opportunities. Eligible teams must apply these funds to the Design-Inspired Healthcare project.\r\n\r\nFunds received beyond the matching grant pool would go towards a sustaining fund to build and grow a Design-Inspired Healthcare community space. Initial use of funds include:\r\nPart-time Executive Director with a background in marketing and community management\r\nPlatform fees for Village Insights, an innovation-specific community platform that would replace Slack or Discord: https://villageinsights.com/\r\n\r\nAccountability\r\nAll funds will be deposited to a multi-signatory Gnosis Safe. Distribution of funds will require approval from at least two grant directors (i.e., @tyhagler @akantuncch) before being awarded to the project teams.\r\n\r\nIf teams do not meet the grant criteria of having completed the workshop and applied for the Flash Grant, then funds will be held for teams that complete the next workshop. \r\n\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\nEXPLORE: Use Case\r\n\r\nAugust - September 2021\r\nFirst Design Thinking Workshop concludes with 3 of 4 clinician-led teams each pitching a novel medical innovation.

Several Cajun and Indigenous communities in SE Louisiana have been damaged by three hurricanes and flooding, were hit hard by COVID-19 and some individual tribes lost most of their infrastructure. Without Internet access, telework, telemedicine, applying for relief funds, protesting online, even telling the story of their plight has not been possible. We are doing two things. First, we are working on getting them community-based WIFI. Second, at the request of one of the communities in Grand Isle, our team wants to co-design a climate advocacy training program to help them petition the government and corporations (many oil, gas, and plastics company operations are contributing to their problems) to make changes. Our goal is to help the community with this capacity, but also make it an open-source training that other Indigenous communities can use. The Undivide Project is asking for this community's help to create new pathways for another community. \r\n\r\nUpdate -- we plan to start the program design in April and recruit trainers from May to early June. This funding will help to pay for curriculum design and trainers. We have already recruited volunteers from the advocacy and activist communities to help!\r\n\r\n** I am so grateful for all of your contributions and for spreading the word about our work. It's a good start. We can do this for about $1000 and we have $500 from this and direct contributions. So halfway there!!\r\n\r\n\r\n","reference_url":"https://theundivideproject.org/","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/c52a58eefadf708b21603be8fbdb64ed/The_Undivide_Project_-_white.jpg","admin_address":"0x6E73f3166B2F737E967592F3d9D5a0BdeBcA0ed8","amount_received":"52.4886","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any

- Carbon Reduction & Reforestation - Planting 1 Trillion Trees","slug":"alaeris-carbon-reduction-reforestation-planting-1","description":"Alaeris is a blockchain platform that incentivizes real world action. The philosophical battle to reverse climate change centers around a conflict between short-term advantage and long-term disadvantage. This conflict delays climate action because people will always value a short-term tangible gain over a long-term intangible gain and over long-term tangible costs. Although Web2 matured the breadth and depth of carbon markets, Web2 has fallen short in incentivizing large scale participation in carbon markets as the long-term benefits did not outweigh the short-term costs.\r\n\r\nWeb3 technology gives us the opportunity to disarm this philosophical conflict and create participation spur action based on Web3 rewards and and community in carbon markets. Web3 has proven a powerful mechanism to drive community participation in financial markets, and we are initially going to point that powerful mechanism at carbon markets. \r\n\r\nAlaeris is creating the world’s first Proof-of-Impact Web3 model that will drive planetary scale carbon removal through reforestation. The Alaeris Proof-of-Impact model rewards stakeholders at every layer of the reforestation and carbon removal process. What Bitcoin did for the crypto community Alaeris will do for the climate community eager for a climate solution with tangible effects that is not based on government involvement or intervention. \r\n\r\nLarge players have validated the huge market opportunity at the intersection of crypto markets and carbon markets. Thus far competition has failed to capture that opportunity because they are either specialized in crypto or in carbon, but not in both. The Alaeris Proof-of-Impact model is what galvanizes the crypto and carbon markets together in a way that has not previously been possible, unlocking the entire TAM to us. We are initially targeting voluntary carbon reduction reforestation projects.\r\n\r\nWe have an execution focused roadmap that we are already overachieving on to create near-term value and a quick path to launch. Our team of experts has notable experience in crypto, climate, startups, and exits. Looking deeper into the future, we believe the Alaeris Proof-of-Impact model can be applied to other complex problems that lack incentives in the traditional economic markets. \r\n\r\nWe would love to have you help us create a company that brings purpose to Web3 by implementing a Blockchain Platform that Incentivizes Real World action.","reference_url":"https://alaeris.com","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/3c336580b2160ed1d59e7505b593666f/Asset_44x.png","admin_address":"0x4eC7F6Cd89652FD1a367c1492712ae80Ff197C08","amount_received":"15.5135","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any

Strategy - ERC-20 Votes With Override","slug":"snapshot-strategy-erc-20-votes-with-override","description":"Update: I have a proposal up on Snapshot to demonstrate this strategy! If you hold any $ENS tokens and have them delegated (either to yourself or someone else), then go here and vote! 🐱 or 🐶?\r\n\r\n========================================================================\r\n\r\nWorking on a new Snapshot strategy: erc20-votes-with-override\r\n\r\nIt works the same way as the existing erc20-votes strategy that ENS and other DAOs use, except that it also allows individuals who delegated to someone else to still vote individually if they want!\r\n\r\nSo if you see your delegate vote differently than you want to, you can override that vote by individually voting yourself on the proposal. Or, if your delegate doesn’t vote at all, you can still vote individually on a proposal. You must still actually be delegated though, if your account is not delegated then your local token balance will not count towards your voting power, same as today.\r\n\r\nUsing a strategy like this could improve voter participation. Maybe some people would like to vote on a single issue, but don’t want to spend the gas/effort to delegate to themselves, vote, and then delegate back. And since it’s on Snapshot, it’s all gas-free for everyone.\r\n\r\nThis might only make sense for social (off-chain only) proposals because of the possible discrepancy in off-chain Snapshot versus actual on-chain votes. But, it sounds like a strategy like this could still help out a lot on various social proposals.\r\n\r\nAlso, working on an additional tool that can query the Snapshot API for a proposal and generate a report of the \"override\" voters. This can help determine how much the Snapshot outcome was affected by these voters, so that you could still use this strategy for proposals that will have an on-chain vote as well.\r\n\r\nUpdate 3/15: The initial version was merged and is available on Snapshot now!\r\n\r\nI am now in the process of making it compatible with Snapshot delegations. In case you weren't aware, users can delegate to another address through Snapshot itself as well. Typically a separate \"delegation\" strategy is used, but that won't work for in case because of how the overridden voting power is calculated. So I'm working on updating the strategy to optionally also pull in Snapshot delegations from the subgraph: https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/pull/463/files\r\n\r\nAlso working on a script that you can use to report which votes on a proposal were \"overrides\".\r\n\r\nUpdate 3/21: The strategy now supports Snapshot delegations as well! Also, I have an initial version of my report tool ready!\r\n\r\nThe strategy itself is up on the Snapshot Labs repository: https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/tree/master/src/strategies/erc20-votes-with-override\r\n\r\nIt's live on Snapshot now too, so you can try it out in your own space.\r\n\r\nI also have a tool written that you can use to generate a report for a Snapshot proposal using the erc20-votes-with-override strategy. It will report out which delegators overrode their delegates, and how much that affected the overall outcome with deltas for each proposal choice.

PORTFOLIO - the portfolio App owned and governed by the users.","slug":"asa-portfolio-the-portfolio-app-owned-and-governe","description":"Our project was born in late December 2021, when a group of close friends investing in the Algorand ecosystem discovered the need for a smartphone app to track ASAs and their price variations in a quick and easy way.\r\nAs a group of mixed professionals, with developers, marketing leaders, lawyers, and businessmen, we soon realized we had found a market niche for a great product, that would also contribute to growing the Algorand ecosystem and provide an excellent tool, especially for newcomers.\r\nWe decided to build our project around a decentralized structure, which would evolve through various stages until it would become a DAO: a project funded by users, governed and driven by users, and capable of generating its own income and profits, which would also belong to the users.\r\nAfter drafting the website and beginning to build the app's software, we started a pre-sale, which funds would be destined to provide the initial liquidity for the project.\r\nThe creation of a token for the project was conditioned to finding the right use case for it, which is to help build the app, regardless of price speculation and volatility. As the project advances and the demand for its token increases, its reserves are exchanged to developers, marketers, designers, and all kinds of advisors needed to build the autonomous app.\r\nOnce the app has been launched, advertising deals have been signed and it becomes profitable, those profits are shared with active holders of our token, each to their proportion of the total.\r\nTo avoid complications inherent to being labeled as a security token, those dividends can only be obtained by actively participating in the project, via governance, strategic decisions, marketing, advising, beta testing, etc. Owning $APF implies having to participate in the project just like one more member of the team would.\r\nFor the first stage of the project, the co-founders have been funding all expenses from our own pockets, and from a tiny award from Headline, of 1670 algos, destined to projects that are building governance-related tools.\r\nAs said, the algos obtained in the pre-sale will be locked in the Liquidity Launch Event, and while pre-sale participants beta test the app and wait for the distribution of their allocated shares, there'll be a price-discovery period where the token is traded freely in an AMM.\r\nThe project won't start getting any revenues until the app is launched in the summer, and we start getting users to leverage negotiations with sponsors for the ads.\r\nThe most critical phase, therefore, will be the next 4-5 months until we can launch the app, because we will face multiple expenses from play/ios store, we'll have to rent a server to build an API and web service to track all prices and ASA pool variations, and also we'll need to pay external developers, marketing, community managers, etc.\r\nRight now we have not received sufficient grants of awards, no funds at all from any other source, and the project is at risk unless we can sufficiently fund all expenses during this stage.\r\nWe believe we are good candidates for your grant because our app is a tool that will improve the user experience for new investors in the Algorand Ecosystem, that will find an easy gate into their investments, that they can check many times a day on their phone.\r\nOur project also brings community value, as we're building a DAO where all decisions about the app's progress will be made by submitting them to governance votes among the users.

We are creating the first implementation in a multiplayer game called Minetest. But it is the basis of a governance framework that can be included into many other multiplayer game-spaces, including Web3-enabled ones.\r\n\r\nWith preliminary funding from an artist residency, we have developed an initial working prototype. But more work is necessary to ensure that Modpol can be usable and extensible. With this grant, we hope to make Modpol more of a real option that game developers can use.\r\n\r\nFunds will go through the Media Enterprise Design Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nWhat if our online communities had the tools to practice a fuller range of self-organized possibilities?\r\nWe are part of a network called the Metagovernance Project, which is experimenting with building such tools. \"Modular Politics\" is a proposal we developed that outlines basic principles for online governance tools, such as:\r\n\r\nModularity: Platform operators and community members should have the ability to construct systems by creating, importing, and arranging composable parts together as a coherent whole.\r\nExpressiveness: The governance layer should be able to implement as wide a range of processes as possible.\r\nPortability: Governance tools developed for one platform should be portable to another platform for reuse and adaptation.\r\nInteroperability: Governance systems operating on different platforms and protocols should have the ability to interact with each other, sharing data and influencing each other’s processes.\r\n\r\nWe decided to try implementing Modular Politics in a place where people are already meeting as peers, on their own terms: Minetest, an open-source, community-created, world-building game. It resembles the more popular, Microsoft-owned game Minecraft. Our Metagov colleague Seth Frey did a large study of Minecraft servers and found that autocracy is the norm; but would that still be the case if gamers had a different set of tools?\r\n\r\nTranslating the Modular Politics proposal into code has raised loads of questions that we never considered when it was all just in our heads and in words. We have had to appreciate more deeply than ever that software design is a political act. How we shape the inner workings and outer interactions will guide users' expectations and behavior. Engineering decisions shape the kinds of communities that users end up creating.\r\n\r\nModpol, as we call our implementation, is still very much a work in progress. (Come pitch in here!) But there are a few design decisions we have made so far that we're excited about—decisions that shift from the feudal defaults to defaults that are more consentful, even communal. Whatever you call them, these choices seem to better reflect how human beings in the wild actually behave together.\r\n\r\nGroups, not roles. Rather than assigning particular powers to particular users, Modpol assigns powers to groups, which we call \"orgs.\" Orgs can determine how to use those powers and how to make decisions about them, but ultimately it is on the level of group membership, not individual permissions, that things happen.\r\n\r\nConsent, not oligarchy. The default decision-making process for orgs is consent of all members. This might sound utopian, but we believe it best resembles how groups of peers actually tend to interact, and it works so well most of the time that we don't even notice it. Ultimately, we hope to see a wide range of other governance \"modules\" that orgs can adopt, from clever voting schemes to juries and more. Users can decide to create an autocracy if they want, such as by delegating decisions to an org with only one member. But in Modpol autocracy is something that must be actively chosen by the members of an org—the \"consent of the governed\"—rather than being the presumption at the outset.\r\n\r\nInheritance, not blank slates. Most online platforms treat communities as parallel, indistinguishable software objects with no particular relationship to each other, each a blank slate upon its creation. Real social life, however, is infused with habit, tradition, and muscle-memory. Modpol attempts to reflect that. New orgs form within existing orgs, and they inherit the rules of their parents. Those rules can be changed. But the rules begin with whatever users were already doing before, so they can work with what they already know rather than starting from scratch.\r\n\r\nMinetest is a game for building worlds. Really, it's an engine for many games, which players have developed and shared with each other. What nearly all Minetest games have in common is that they are places to build—block upon block. Players explore landscapes, gather resources, and use them to create the kinds of spaces they want to inhabit and show off.\r\n\r\nModpol is also meant for building. Players can create worlds of interlocking orgs, each with their own rules and processes. Modpol could be used to organize teams for Capture the Flag, or to govern an anarchist castle. It could enable experiments that explore the features and bugs of various ways of organizing and decision-making. Minetest is an engine for manipulating blocks in virtual space; Modpol is an engine for manipulating the flows of online politics.\r\n\r\nWithin orgs, users can choose the set of modules available to each other. In doing, they can craft their own rule-sets. They can create their own modules (for now, most are about a page-worth of code). Modules can call modules, which can call modules; what starts as simple can quickly become complex.\r\n\r\nThe code is in Lua, the language Minetest understands. Lua was first developed in Brazil in the early 1990s as a lightweight language for embedding extensions into bigger programs. It is quirky and elegant, without the features and libraries it would need to run complex, modern programs on its own. In Portuguese, lua means \"moon.\" Lua programs are orbiters, circling around other programs. They make no claim to be self-sufficient. This is fitting, because there is no point in governance tools without a world and a community worth co-governing.\r\n\r\nMaps could be built for other Lua worlds—maybe Roblox, maybe Angry Birds, and lots more.\r\nWith this design, we hope that someday Modpol will travel to other worlds. But for now, we go on assembling this prototype. We're working with members of the Minetest community, who are skilled in the arts of commoning. Before leaving their orbit, we want to offer something of value to this particular species of world-builders, and learn together some lessons about the intergalactic possibilities in our minutest

Venture Capital platform","slug":"memedaocommunity-driven-venture-capital-platform","description":"1. Introduction\r\n\r\n\tAs the cryptocurrency market continues to grow at an astonishing rate, new coins are emerging\r\nsingle day. But for ordinary investment, many cryptocurrency investments have high thresholds.\r\n\tParticipating in private investments or public sales of tokens has always been a major issue, whether investing in IDO、IEO or through exchanges or even storing tokens in wallets. As we embark on the journey of decentralized finance, many will create products and services that will continue to prosper for thousands of years. However, we struggled with the fact that while participating in many token sales, different tokens were launched on different launchpads. Investors have to buy platform tokens from different launchpads to get their purchase quota.\r\n\tAs cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow, the need for measures to be taken becomes more obvious by the day. This is because there are constantly new crypto adopters entering this concept without fully understanding the practices and technical aspects. In addition, there are the fundamentals of blockchain as a whole.\r\n\tMeMeDAO, as a community-driven venture capital platform, is committed to solving the problems of investors when investing.\r\n\r\n1.1 What's MeMeDAO\r\n\r\n\tFrom 2021, the entire cryptocurrency market has ushered in a very good stage of development. Many cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, ETH, etc., have ushered in the highest price point in history. In particular, Metaverse and Web3-related cryptocurrencies have the best performances in the market throughout 2021. However, through our survey, many ordinary investors do not have a good opportunity to participate in the private sale or public sale of such cryptocurrencies. Large investment institutions, such as Huobi, Binance, OKex, a16z, etc., participated in the relevant token sales at extremely low prices. Due to the high threshold of private placement, it is difficult for many investors to obtain returns similar to venture capital platforms.\r\n\tMeMeDAO  which is created by a number of geeks who oppose the gap between the rich and the poor, is a community-driven venture capital platform. MeMeDAO, such as Ark Invest or Tuttle Capital Management in real life, is a relatively well-known meme token focused on investing in promising startup cryptocurrency teams. The goal of MeMeDAO is to allow everyone in the blockchain world to enjoy the dividends of cryptocurrencies.\r\n\tAs a community-driven venture capital platform, every MeMeDAO token holder is equal and has the right to submit proposals to the community, including improving community governance, deciding which tokens to invest in, and how to realize the distribution of investment profits etc. All governance and proposals are deployed by the community in a decentralized manner.\r\n\r\n1.2 Why choose MeMeDAO\r\n\r\n\tIn reality, the gap between the rich and the poor is growing. In the real society and the blockchain world, whether a higher return can be obtained in investment depends to a large extent on the channel and time difference of obtaining information, as well as the vision of investors. As an ordinary investor, it is difficult for people to judge the value of the invested company or token and the timeliness of obtaining information.\r\n\tIn particular, many better cryptocurrencies require higher thresholds in the initial stage of financing, for example, they require investors to invest more than hundreds of thousands of dollars or individual investors cannot participate in their private sales. For an ordinary investor with a small amount of capital, the amount of hundreds of thousands of dollars is a huge amount of money, and it is difficult for ordinary investors to spend this money to participate in it. So how does MeMeDAO solve these problems.\r\n\tAs the old oriental proverb says, the fire is high when people gather materials. If in a large community, each token holder contributes his own news, it seems to be a good way to determine which token to invest in through community voting. MeMeDAO is committed to bringing all ordinary investors together, exerting the ability of every community member, and gathering everyone's strength to invest.\r\n\r\n2. How it Works\r\n\r\n\tThe DAO is fully community led.Everyone who holds the token can participate in the proposal, and everyone is equal in MeMeDAO.\r\n\tWe have prepared an initial governance model for the DAO, as shown in the image below, which can be approved by our first vote. First, community members will share draft proposals in the forum for community discussion. This proposal template should be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFollowing community discussion, the proposal will be reviewed by the consensus unit. Their job is to screen proposals to see if they will yield benefits to token holders before they are published on the snapshot. If the consensus group believes that the proposal may have significant potential risks, they may reject the proposal.\r\n\tIf the proposal is accepted by the consensus unit, it will be added to the snapshot.\r\n\r\n3. Dividends\r\n\r\n\tAfter the venture capital obtains the corresponding profits, how to distribute the profits becomes the concern of MeMeDAO and the community. In order to ensure the interests of every investor, MeMeDAO profits are distributed according to the MeMeDAO token holdings of each address. This means that when a proposal is executed until the profit distribution period, users who hold MeMeDAO longer and hold more will share the benefits of venture capital. At present, we divide the rules of profit distribution into three models: stablecoin dividends, repurchase dividends, and the combination of these two models. If the community has a better dividend distribution model, MeMeDAO will implement profit distribution according to the proposal.\r\n\r\n3.1 By stable coin\r\n\r\n\tIn order to better guarantee the rights of holders, MeMeDAO allows every holder to enjoy the dividends of investment through the dividends of stablecoins. MeMeDAO mainly distributes dividends through corresponding stablecoins in the market, such as USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI.\r\n\tConsidering the high network fees of the Ethereum network, each investor will have a dividend account. Holders of MeMeDAO can wait until the accumulated dividend is greater than the Ethereum network fee to claim.\r\n\r\n3.2 Buy-Back Mechanism\r\n\r\n\tThe buy-back mechanism originated from meme tokens. This model is to repurchase tokens by charging a certain fee each time users trade in the primary market, which has achieved the purpose of increasing the currency price.\r\n\tMeMeDAO makes good use of this pattern. After investing in tokens through investment funds to obtain corresponding returns, MeMeDAO will use the profits to buy back tokens in the primary market. With each large repurchase, the price of MeMeDAO will be further increased accordingly. Every token holder will benefit from the increased token price.\r\n\tMeMeDAO makes good use of this pattern. After investing in tokens through investment funds to obtain corresponding returns, MeMeDAO will use the profits to buy back tokens in the primary market. With each large repurchase, the price of MeMeDAO will be further increased accordingly. Every token holder will benefit from the increased token price.\r\n\r\n3.3 By stable coin and buy-back Mechanism\r\n\r\n\tCombining the above two dividend modes, it distributes profits through a certain percentage. First of all, according to a certain proportion, the profit obtained from the investment is divided into two parts, one for the stablecoin is distributed to each MeMeDAO holder, and the other is to buy back MeMeDAO tokens to increase the currency price.\r\n\tThe advantage of this model is that it both satisfies some conservative holders and attracts new cryptocurrency investors to join the MeMeDAO community. The default distribution ratio is 50%, that is, half of the profits are used for stablecoin dividends, and half of the profits are used for buy-back.The allocation ratio can be changed through proposals.\r\n\r\n3.4 Others\r\n\r\n\tOther dividend distribution methods can be implemented according to community proposals, and every community member with the right to propose a proposal is

The better you take care of your pets the quicker they grow and evolve. You'll need to log in often to make sure your pets aren't hungry, tired, lonely, bored, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game includes modes for exercising/training your pet to keep them active. You'll also be able to let your pets play with each other for socialization. You'll learn over time which food and activities your pet prefers the most. These modes are great for casual players who enjoy pet raising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to these modes, we'll also have battling (PvP and PvE) and pet breeding. Players will earn rewards which include tokens and in-game items (food, toys, etc). We will also have a system for breeding pets.

Why? Mental health was an afterthought.\r\n\r\nThis project centers on the people of the ENS and ENS DAO ecosystem. The creators of tools and procedures and the people impacted by these tools and procedures.\r\n\r\nThis research and report are on the current state of people's mental health in the ENS and ENS DAO ecosystem. The intention is to design it to generate outcomes and action. We're not publishing data to create yet another report that its intended audience will not use. Yes, we're tired of those too.\r\n\r\nWhile the focus is on the ENS and ENS DAO ecosystem, the report and insights will be available for public use to help other ecosystems. Our goal is generational change by centering on mental health today in web3, not ten years from now. \r\n\r\nShort Roadmap\r\nResearch study\r\nPublish report with data and insights\r\nPublish recommended action items (qualitative and quantitative) for ENS and ENS DAO Ecosystem based on data and insights\r\nPublish outcomes from actions items\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n\"I'll sleep when I'm dead.\" Have you heard that before reading this? You might have said it at one point in your life. That mindset is a quick path to, at best, the hospital and, at worst, the cemetery. Plus, when you're dead, you are dead. There's no waking up from that.\r\n\r\nWith self-sovereignty, public good, and digital identities, comes a significant shift in personal responsibility and how people interact with the world.\r\n\r\nWe intend to have data and insights linked with specific actions for the ENS and ENS DAO ecosystem and community. While we can't change what has already happened, we can re-center mental health as part of the foundation for all tools and policies created in the ENS and ENS DAO ecosystem. \r\n\r\nThis project is part of the beginning instead of cure-all. Our goal is to be proactive and preventative rather than reactive, which has been the case in web2. This project is shining a light on what, up until this point, has been one-off stories of mental health challenges. It's a nice change of pace to help the ENS and ENS DAO ecosystem while the foundation is being created instead of trying to retrofit solutions.\r\n\r\nThere will be hundreds of tools created for the ENS and ENS DAO ecosystem. This project focuses on the people making and using the tools and impacted by policies and procedures. With the outcomes from this project, we can move from solely focusing on tools to the impact that the tools will make on individuals and the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe term community has been around long before web3 existed. People have been at the core of every community and ecosystem throughout history. Every decision each individual in the community and ecosystem makes is grounded in the state of their mental health. The report and action items will be an artifact, baseline, and resource for the ENS and ENS DAO Ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe ENS and the ENS DAO continue to expand. The change will impact the mental health of existing and new people in the ENS ecosystem. That said, some people will choose not to change their behaviors.\r\n\r\nBy centering on mental health, we will directly impact the ENS and ENS DAO Ecosystem from community interactions, policies and procedures, and tools and platforms.\r\n\r\nGenerational impact on the ENS and ENS DAO Ecosystem, and web3\r\nSet a foundation that supports the mental health of entrepreneurs, creators, customers, and community members\r\nAs the ENS and ENS DAO continue to expand by the number of people and tools, if we don't have an awareness of mental health baked into the foundation, we will repeat web2 mistakes. \r\nSupport the people building the tools and the ones using the tools.\r\nFocus on the entire ecosystem, including archivists, scribes, marketers, attorneys, translators, interpreters, and future roles \r\nReduce the hurdles that cause negative stress for non-developer interactions with ENS and ENS DAO ecosystem\r\nImprove adoption and awareness by being an ecosystem and community that is proactive with mental health rather than reactionary.\r\n\r\nThe mental health of people connected to the ENS and ENS DAO Ecosystem\r\nWeb3 has an \"always-on\" flow which has and will continue to lead to the following, which are all made worse from scams, bullying, sexism, racism, and much more.\r\nFOMO - Fear of Missing Out\r\nBurnout\r\nOverwhelm from various parts of the ecosystem, learning a new language (acronyms, existing terms like rugged or noob, computer terms, etc.), new tech (Discord, etc.)\r\nAnxiety\r\nDepression\r\nFinancial stress\r\nPandemic much? This pandemic has impacted the majority of the people on Earth, including the people connected to ENS and the ENS DAO Ecosystem.\r\n\r\nOutcomes focused on Action\r\nFocused on results and behavior change instead of optics and media stunts\r\nContent will be publicly accessible\r\nSpecific actions (qualitative and quantitative) recommended to ENS DAO Working Groups and ENS Ecosystem\r\nProgress reports on the recommended actions\r\n\r\nRoadmap - 3 to 6 months\r\nFinalize research study design\r\nQualitative and quantitative research\r\nConfirm and announce team members as they are added\r\nStart the research process through multiple communication channels to the global ENS Community (ENS DAO, $ENS holders/yet to be claimed, supporters, etc.)\r\nData analysis and review\r\nPublish State of Mental Health of People in ENS Report online\r\nHost online events for multiple time zones\r\nShare recommended action steps with ENS and ENS DAO, including working groups.\r\nPublish progress reports on recommended action steps\r\nOngoing research and action with a focus on outcomes, not data for the sake of data\r\n\r\nMatching Funds\r\nThe total amount of Matching Funds is based on your contribution and the verification level of your profile (Trust Bonus - see FAQs below).

In short, with QF, it's better for ten people to contribute $1.00 ($10.00) than to have one person contribute $10.\r\nThis project is part of the Main Round for GR13 and two Ecosystem Rounds, ENS and Radicle. The rounds happen at the same time and have a maximum matching amount: Main (2.5% of $1.2M), ENS (10% of $69,420), and Radicle (10% of$25,000). \r\nSPECIAL NOTE:\r\nAs part of the Radicle Ecosystem Round, we’re stoked to be able to commit a total of 25% of the matching funds from Radicle to the following 5 grants in GR13. The funding allocation will be automated using the Radicle Drips platform.\r\n(5%) ENS Newsletter - https://gitcoin.co/grants/4861/ens-dao-newsletter\r\nWhy? There is so much information to consume when it comes to the ENS Ecosystem. The ENS Newsletter is an accessible way for people to consume content especially since they decided to add a non-ENS Forum version of the newsletter.\r\n(5%) Planting fruit trees in 64 schools and 40 health centers across Tororo district in Uganda East Africa / Ecosystems Restoration in Uganda - https://gitcoin.co/grants/4014/planting-fruit-trees-in-64-schools-and-40-health-\r\nWhy? This project combines two causes that need more attention and resources: helping the planet and sustainable food security\r\n(5%) Nectar: zk-rollups and HIPAA compliant decentralized storage for the $7T healthcare system - https://gitcoin.co/grants/3475/nectar-zk-rollups-and-hipaa-compliant-decentraliz\r\nWhy?

They are using digital currencies to eradicate poverty and redefine value exchange in communities.\r\n\r\nFunding Use\r\nThe following are the current main areas for the use of funding:\r\nTeam, tech, and tools to get the work completed\r\nPublishing of report including translations into multiple languages\r\nHost multiple virtual events to accommodate global time zones\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nAnthony Ware, Principal, AWare Catalysts\r\nIn this project, my team and I are focused on making sure that a business like my current one doesn't need to exist for web3 in 10 years because we helped create a people and mental health-centric foundation. I am not a technology developer. I focus on the impact of the tools and tech created by developers on the mental health of everyone in the ENS and ENS DAO ecosystem.\r\nI'm a Mental Wealth Strategist and Principal at AWare Catalysts. My life is a spicy gumbo with a side of cheesecake. During my 10+ years as a serial entrepreneur, I successfully launched five companies in multiple industries, including logistics and information security. As a speaker, moderator, and panelist, I've shared my insights and frameworks on mental wealth and health for audiences and organizations in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. \r\nThe diverse intersections of my life experiences have helped me develop a deep level of empathy and grace. This foundation allows me to connect with people, find key insights, and synthesize solutions to help people in powerful ways.\r\nI'm a proud alumnus of Purdue University with a degree in Biochemistry. When I'm not working to help people create generational mental wealth, I've traveled to 7 countries and finished three marathons and three half-marathons.\r\nQuick notes on me:\r\nENS DAO \r\n$ENS token holder\r\nNominee to be Steward of ENS DAO Public Goods (PG) Working Group (WG)\r\nEven though I wasn't selected, I'm attending PG WG meetings to learn and uncover ways to contribute.\r\nHere's my Position Statement as a PG WG Nominee [https://snapshot.org/#/nominations.ens.eth/proposal/0x9e60f0d8443c7722dd1b92ab67b936d77054f734c1ae1a8418bb72d5fb08a870]\r\nResearched and published the Founder Mental Wealth Report at the end of 2019: https://foundermentalwealth.com/report/\r\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/theanthonyware\r\nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonyware/\r\nInterviews and Panels:\r\nTech Intersect - Episode 98 - https://open.spotify.com/episode/4TGehrGjB5MyhVu2hCfbRa?si=haUPQA1GRtSYrm2BcIVmuQ\r\nTech Intersect - Episode 6 - https://open.spotify.com/episode/4TRE36hMb5DLi3J9Tr7JhX?si=WcRHHBVoQF-2_QJWXo8mlA\r\nTech Inclusion 2020 - Managing Your Mental Health in a Pandemic while Building Mental Wealth for a Post-Pandemic World - https://youtu.be/_svtSqjytqU\r\nIcon Summit 2021 - How Companies Can Support Your Mental Health (panel) - https://youtu.be/NU0nVPWWPII\r\nIcon Summit 2019 - The Time is Now for Mental Health and Wellness in Tech (panel) - https://theiconproject.org/events/the-time-is-now-for-mental-health-and-wellness-in-tech/\r\nAdditional team members will come from my network, the community, and Runner (https://www.hirerunner.co/ | https://twitter.com/hirerunner)  \r\n\r\nASK:\r\nCONTRIBUTE - Contribute an amount you are comfortable with making today. even 1 DAI ($1 USD) will make an impact thanks to the Quadratic Funding method of Gitcoin (see FAQs below).

X $gOHM product on Arbitrum","slug":"entropyfi-x-gohm-product-on-arbitrum","description":"Entropyfi is a platform offering lossless derivatives. Entropyfi currently offers lossless asset prediction markets, rebase-token soft-hedge strategy, and rebase-token soft-leverage strategy products on Polygon network. Entropyfi is soon coming to other scaling solutions and networks.\r\n\r\nEntropyfi’s lossless prediction market allows users to stake stable coins and wager the yield on the stablecoins to predict Bitcoin price, Tesla stock price, and OHM price. The lossless prediction market product allows users with a low risk-preference to safely engage in market speculation activities. Users’ winnings are automatically compounded, hence making the lossless prediction market also ideal for stablecoin holders to weather through the bear markets (looking at you stablespartan lol)\r\n\r\nEntropyfi soft-hedge product and soft-leverage product are developed specifically for rebase tokens. If I’m in for the long-term for the rebase project, I foresee a short-term negative price action. I can hedge against rebase token price going down. If the price does go down, I can receive additional rebase rewards from people who predicted otherwise, and the additional rebase rewards can help offset the impact of price depreciation. Here is a link to the analysis (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e6olRoFhVoLUTLAeUe2SQgdulEGb3k76/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104825538474962212039&rtpof=true&sd=true) on the effect of soft hedge.\r\n\r\nSoft-leverage is a liquidation free alternative to (9,9). If I'm really bullish about the project and want to leverage my staking, but I don't want to face liquidation risk. Then soft leverage is the perfect tool for me to manage the risk. If the price is indeed higher at settlement, I will not only benefit from the additional boosted rebase reward, but also the price appreciation of the token. I cannot get liquidated if the market does not go as I planned. I will only lose their rebase reward.\r\n\r\nWe wish to create a soft-hedge and soft-leverage markets for OHM stakers, and use the grants we received to subsidize OHM stakers who have used our soft leverage and soft hedge products. We believe that our product will bring positive impact to (3,3), as people who a bearish outlook for the price action do not have to offload their tokens to create further downward price pressure. We also bring positive impact to (9,9) as we strategy allows users to enjoy a higher yield without causing a liquidation cascade.\r\n\r\nOn our roadmap, we are currently developing options products and covered leverage staking products.\r\n\r\nMilestones:\r\n\r\nMilestone 0 (30%):\r\nEntropyfi team to develop soft hedge smart contracts (Done)\r\nEntropyfi team to develop soft leverage smart contracts (Done)\r\nEntropyfi team to deploy both smart contracts for a rebase project (Done, deployed with VESQ on Polygon)\r\n\r\n\r\nMilestone 1 (30%):\r\nEntropyfi team to modify the smart contracts to support gOHM, as gOHM balance itself won’t grow by the index will (estimate completion in mid Feburary)\r\nEntropyfi team to deploy both smart contracts on Arbitrum testnet (estimate completion in mid Feburary)\r\nEntropyfi team to deploy both smart contracts on Arbitrum mainnet and test integration with gOHM (estimated completion in end of February)\r\n\r\nMilestone 2 (40%): \r\nEntropyfi to modify existing soft hedge and soft leverage front-end for gOHM staking (estimated completion in mid March)\r\nEntropyfi to officially launch gOHM soft hedge and soft leverage

Working in Web3 global user research study","slug":"women-working-in-web3-global-user-research-study","description":"This grant proposal is to fund a global research study on the experiences of women working in the web3 space. The study aims to provide concrete, robust qualitative and quantitative research findings to the broader web3 ecosystem about the real, lived experiences of women working in web3 in 2022.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this research are to:\r\n* Through robust and accurate research methods, create a source of truth that aligns the ecosystem around hard data.\r\n* Identify needs, pains and blockers, that hamper women from entering the space or thriving in it.\r\n* Produce recommendations applicable to all protocols, funders, hiring managers, DAOs, investors, and other researchers.\r\n\r\nWhy fund this grant proposal?\r\n* Existing data indicates that the crypto and web3 world is predominantly male - both with regards to end users and the people building the technology.\r\n* It is well known that in order to build truly equitable products, you must have a workforce that reflects the diversity of users you are building for. A diverse workforce fosters greater innovation. \r\n** With the focus on ‘buidl’ there may not be the diversity and inclusion initiatives, robust hiring practises, or even the organizational cultures that encourage women to work in the space, or provide the best opportunities for them to thrive. As we experiment with new ways of working, with DAOs, how are women considered in the design of organizations? What is their experience like? How could it be better?\r\n\r\nThe deliverables from this research will include: \r\n* A public facing detailed report outlining the method, findings and recommendations.\r\n* Public presentations of the results via video and open office hours for teams looking to work with the findings.\r\n\r\nHow will funds be used?\r\n* The project has been scoped and budgeted, and I hope to receive funding from multiple sources to make the research a reality.\r\n* The plan follows a generative research study approach; stakeholder engagement with a range of protocols, funders, women-focussed web3 organizations and business leaders; design of the study; qualitative user interviews (approximately 35); analysis of the interviews; design of the quant study (to test the qual learnings at scale); quant data collection via a survey; final analysis and report writing; socialisation of the findings and recommendations. Total researcher time is estimated at ~170 hours.\r\n* If this research is adequately funded, the research findings will be published and shared in Q3 of 2022.\r\n\r\nWho will conduct this research?\r\nGeorgia Rakusen is one of the most experienced user researchers in the web3 space. As a crypto user since 2013, a professional researcher for 9 years (4 of which have been exclusively in the blockchain/web3 space), she is uniquely positioned to deliver on this proposal. As User Research Lead at ConsenSys for 2.5 years, Georgia delivered high value strategic insights based on real user experiences to a range of product teams building for developers, institutions, and general consumers, including Protocol Labs for the Filecoin launch, and the launch of MetaMask’s token swap feature. Georgia currently works freelance, for the likes of MakerDAO, MetaMask, dHedge, Deep Work, Rarible, and many others. \r\n\r\nExamples of previously published user research reports:\r\n\r\nDeFi user research study (2020) \r\nETH 2 Staking validator study (2020) \r\nCBDC user research for MIT and the US Federal Reserve (2021) \r\n\r\nPlease support this grant proposal and help make this research a reality.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in participating in this research, as a consulted stakeholder or research participant, please reach out to me on Twitter, or email georgia.rakusen@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reference_url":"https://xn--ei8hnm24d.y.at/","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/d4fe4468fb42ca7599dc14e601170b81/Group_2.png","admin_address":"0xB781697a675300EF26280E840661C9E89188B316","amount_received":"27.1501","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-105698997,"related":[[12,3],[5257,2],[4953,2],[5400,1],[5359,1],[5317,1],[5290,1],[5264,1],[5023,1],[5016,1],[4794,1],[191,1],[5374,1],[5249,1],[5351,1],[5234,1],[5133,1],[5199,1],[5121,1],[5100,1],[5092,1],[4965,1],[5039,1],[4999,1],[4934,1],[4926,1],[4858,1],[4493,1],[4850,1],[4847,1],[4578,1],[4747,1],[4679,1],[4659,1],[4551,1],[4460,1],[4268,1],[4287,1],[4143,1],[3987,1],[3753,1],[3905,1],[3760,1],[3626,1],[3595,1],[3474,1],[3372,1],[2854,1],[2841,1],[4832,1],[4795,1],[4537,1],[2785,1],[2112,1],[1855,1],[1634,1],[1561,1],[384,1],[258,1],[149,1]],"upcoming":-100016500,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1648628781.7153003,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1648663331.8540988,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1648663331.8885128},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":75949,"url":"/georakusen","name":"Georgia Rakusen","handle":"georakusen","keywords":[],"position":508,"followers":5,"following":7,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/2f8bc5b90101195234415d613ba8b185/georakusen.png","github_url":"https://github.com/georakusen","grants_owned":2,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":0},"team_members":[{"id":75949,"url":"/georakusen","name":"Georgia Rakusen","handle":"georakusen","keywords":[],"position":508,"followers":5,"following":7,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/2f8bc5b90101195234415d613ba8b185/georakusen.png","github_url":"https://github.com/georakusen","grants_owned":2,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":0}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"27.1501","positive_round_contributor_count":3,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/d4fe4468fb42ca7599dc14e601170b81/Group_2.png"],"details_url":"/grants/5279/women-working-in-web3-global-user-research-study"},{"id":5276,"active":true,"title":"NFT Nordic","slug":"nft-nordic","description":"The main purpose of NFT Nordic is to landmark the Nordic countries on the global map of the NFT industry.

We represent a huge network of users, creators, developers, organizations, foundations, guilds, niches from across the globe. Lately we have seens massive growth in independent initiatives of blockchain technology and NFTs in the Nordic countries.

Algorand NFT Engine","slug":"zestbloom-algorand-nft-engine","description":"ZestBloom is building a feature-rich, user-friendly NFT marketplace on the Algorand Blockchain. Our goal is to provide low cost, eco-friendly, and secure NFT technology to the masses. In addition to the marketplace, we are building out a suite of smart contracts using Reach that can be launched from anywhere via our API service. The basic set of contracts includes, but is not limited to; list sales, offers, auctions, reverse auctions, NFT competitions, shuffles, on-demand generating minting, and mass drops.\r\nZestBloom will offer a suite of solutions to give artists more control and fewer responsibilities:\r\n\r\nAuthentication: Every NFT managed by ZestBloom comes with a content-based digital signature that aids in copycat detection. Our nodes constantly index the Algorand blockchain looking for misuse and copycats, which are robustly detected even if only a small section of the work is stolen. Giving original creators more control directly reduces opportunities for low-effort content. Cleaning out copycats concentrates attention and bids on only original content.\r\n\r\nSearch: Most NFT marketplaces exist independently and have no incentive to list works on other sites, except for aggregators like OpenSea. However, these aggregators are cluttered and difficult to search because they only use broad categories (art, music, etc.) and only the title/description terms are indexed. Content-based image search is a solved problem and will allow users to navigate similar images by content much like modern image search engines. ZestBloom brings all of the functionalities of Web2 search into the Web3 metaverse.\r\n\r\nRoyalties, collaborations, and resales: Any royalty and resale system requires an enforcement mechanism to prevent attempts to bypass fees or siphon rewards from original artists. Currently, NFTs can be stolen, trivially edited, and reuploaded with a different description and title, and appear in different collectors’ search results to siphon bids. Furthermore, bad actors can fake bids on these pirated works to confuse real collectors into purchasing derivative works. With content-based authentication and search, ZestBloom enables enforceable protection of creators and safe collaboration.\r\n\r\nRather than copying the expensive and exclusive marketplaces on Ethereum, ZestBloom is continuing to advance NFT technology by adding intrinsic value to Algorand’s NFT ecosystem.","reference_url":"https://zestbloom.io","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/64965f96f1cc82b61c42e10aff80d9e2/250x250.png","admin_address":"0x0","amount_received":"51.2720","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-105996989,"related":[[4524,5],[5309,4],[4620,4],[5311,3],[5303,3],[4527,3],[5293,3],[5487,2],[5301,2],[4529,2],[4526,2],[4962,2],[4669,2],[4268,2],[3591,2],[5201,2],[5463,2],[4535,2],[5488,1],[5377,1],[5374,1],[5155,1],[5070,1],[4966,1],[4912,1],[4879,1],[4874,1],[4861,1],[4851,1],[4846,1],[4832,1],[4779,1],[4726,1],[4722,1],[4665,1],[4655,1],[4597,1],[4499,1],[4019,1],[3522,1],[3389,1],[2743,1],[2323,1],[1102,1],[821,1],[184,1],[172,1],[149,1],[13,1],[12,1],[5472,1],[5408,1],[5135,1],[4799,1],[4589,1],[3857,1],[3497,1],[2983,1],[2774,1],[2058,1],[1632,1],[490,1],[329,1],[5404,1],[5323,1],[5305,1],[5291,1],[5244,1]],"upcoming":-100011500,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1648628042.588713,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1648663734.5856884,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1648663324.8583007},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":223775,"url":"/whereisrysmind","name":"Ryan","handle":"whereisrysmind","keywords":["Python","Swift","JavaScript","Arduino"],"position":355,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/a1f8b9b04350e03497bac932e9a9feaf/whereisrysmind.png","github_url":"https://github.com/whereisrysmind","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},"team_members":[{"id":187278,"url":"/temptemp3","name":"Nicholas Shellabarger","handle":"temptemp3","keywords":["Shell","JavaScript","CSS","Elm","HTML","Ruby","C","Haskell","RenderScript","Rust","Python","Batchfile"],"position":680,"followers":10,"following":12,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/a43a7c014b84737ddba3dd5291bbb8d6/temptemp3.svg","github_url":"https://github.com/temptemp3","grants_owned":2,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":4},{"id":223775,"url":"/whereisrysmind","name":"Ryan","handle":"whereisrysmind","keywords":["Python","Swift","JavaScript","Arduino"],"position":355,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/a1f8b9b04350e03497bac932e9a9feaf/whereisrysmind.png","github_url":"https://github.com/whereisrysmind","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},{"id":350585,"url":"/jasmineiris","name":"Jiris","handle":"jasmineiris","keywords":["Swift","Objective-C","JavaScript","C","C++","CSS"],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/8635c06078582a462020c500aa8d8c44/jasmineiris.png","github_url":"https://github.com/jasmineiris","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"51.2720","positive_round_contributor_count":11,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/64965f96f1cc82b61c42e10aff80d9e2/250x250.png"],"details_url":"/grants/5275/zestbloom-algorand-nft-engine"},{"id":5272,"active":true,"title":"How to DAO book","slug":"how-to-dao-book","description":"Education is a key piece of DAO infrastructure, and our goal is to publish the first comprehensive guide for people who want to take the plunge into the world of DAOs. We want to enable more people to leave behind the tyranny of the 9-5 and start contributing to web3.\r\nThe book will be a true cross-DAO collaboration to create a comprehensive view of the DAO ecosystem, and to provide real examples of how anyone can make the jump from “normie” to DAO contributor.  \r\n\r\nWe'll use the funds from the Gitcoin Grant to create and distribute the How to DAO book, which will be provided completely free to students and those who cannot afford it. \r\n\r\nEducation should be a public good, not a privilege. \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nDAOs are poised to be the next chapter in the future of work, yet there are no long-form books on the subject, and very few resources aimed at helping people overcome the barriers to entry that come with the space.\r\n\r\nHow to DAO will  be the first and definitive starting point for introducing the subject to the world beyond crypto Twitter. For the uninitiated, DAOs can be an esoteric and chaotic ecosystem full of unfamiliar terms, tools, and processes. How to DAO has the potential to do to DAO’s what Coingecko’s book did for Defi.\r\n \r\nOur approach will be to =l create two books that work together to address both sides of the DAO equation: those who want to join a community, and those who want to build a community.. The first book will focus  on contributors, helping them understand the culture, conventions, common tooling, and paths to contributor competency. \r\n\r\nThe second book, will focus on the needs of creators, andaddress more advanced concepts, like community management, governance models, tokenomics, and scaling. \r\n\r\nThe entire effort will be a web3-wide collaboration with experts in DAOs and community, who have built their expertise through real-world experience. The contributors will each become “chapter champions,” and focus on a specific topic that is relevant to their expertise. To date, we already have contributors from Gitcoin, Bankless, Index, Mirror, and other top organizations excited to be involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIFICATION\r\nProject Champions\r\nPuncar is an experienced technology consultant working full-time in web3, and is involved extensively with  Bankless Consulting, Index Coop and GitcoinDAO to help communities build thriving DAO ecosystems. . Through his involvement with the DAO community, his role is creating relationships with new and potential Chapter Champions.\r\n\r\nJustice has an extensive project management background and has published several books using the same decentralized methods listed in this proposal. \r\n\r\nRA (Ryan) is a professional marketer with over 20 years of experience and will be leading the strategy, to promote sales of the book, and to raise awareness of the education services we’ll be building to support the book.\r\n\r\nProject Plan\r\nUpon receiving funding we will keep progressing through the following stages:\r\n\r\nPhase 1\r\nDraft a tentative outline of the book. - DONE \r\nCraft our Gitcoin proposal. - DONE\r\nOnboard the chapter champions - In progress\r\nWrite the introduction from our first champion. - In progress\r\nWrite chapter champion submission guidelines. - In progress\r\nCommission a book cover design. - In progress\r\nSolidify the distribution model around the book and its NFTs - In progress\r\n\r\nPhase 2\r\nBegin compiling chapter champion submissions.\r\nThe marketing team prepares the strategy for a book launch.\r\nTeam-up with Unlock protocol to prepare the distribution plan for free and paid versions\r\n\r\nPhase 3\r\nPrivate user testing is conducted. \r\nPublish the book and execute the marketing and distribution plan.\r\nProceeds from the book go into the book treasury and are distributed based on pre-agreed agreement (see financial plan in financial implications chapter).\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT USAGE\r\nAll grants funds will be stored in the How to DAO book internal treasury to pay for: \r\nContribution to the book\r\nManaging the creation of the book, distribution, and marketing\r\nImproving a website for distributing the book and other educational content\r\nPublishing cost\r\n\r\nIn case any funds remain, those will be used for issuing updates and other educational content. \r\n\r\nBRAND USAGE\r\nThis is a cross-DAO collaboration effort - DAOs and contributors will be mentioned with their Web3 names. \r\n\r\nSUCCESS METRICS OR KPI’s\r\nThe first and most immediate metric of success we should look at is web3 onboarding as this is in keeping with our primary mission and values. \r\nIssue the electronic version of the book before the next Grants round \r\nProvide 1000+ free copies to students\r\nInbound links to the DAOs mentioned in the book (unique links might be introduced to track this matrix). \r\nEase of Onboarding - did we help the applicants onboard to Web3 efficiently and manage their expectations?

is building the decentralised payments infrastructure for teams, projects and communities\r\n\r\nIt's a protocol to handle ownership splitting, on-chain product sales and the management of community-owned assets.\r\n\r\nThe Slice ecosystem is based on slicers, smart contracts designed to split any payment they receive to their owners proportionally to their owned slices.\r\n\r\nHow does it work\r\nOwnership over a slicer is represented by slices (ERC1155 tokens) which entitle those who own them to receive a proportional share of any ETH or ERC20 received by the slicer.\r\n\r\nSince slices can be transferred or sold on any NFT marketplace by their owners, they can be also seen as tradable royalties.\r\n\r\nSlicers are also able to receive NFTs (ERC721 and ERC1155) so they can be used as containers to store digital assets and distribute their ownership to the slicer owners.\r\n\r\nDecentralised stores\r\nSlicers can be used to sell products in a fully decentralised manner, similarly as they were distinct e-commerce stores. Users can browse through various stores and add products to their cart, exactly how they would do on a typical e-commerce, with the difference that on Slice the checkout triggers an on-chain transaction.\r\n\r\nSlicer owners can create products that allow buyers to:\r\nDownload files — Such as books, movies, video-courses, etc. which are encrypted and saved immutably on IPFS. They can only be decrypted by the buyers of the relative product;\r\nTrigger an on-chain interaction — Interact with any external contract (i.e. mint NFTs to the buyer’s address, or more generally execute any action on a linked contract);\r\nModify on-chain inventory — The purchase gets recorded on-chain, which can in turn allow to perform an action on the Slice website or on a third-party website - such as redeem a physical product.\r\n\r\nCurrent state of the project\r\nThe Slice protocol is managed by a DAO whose treasury is managed through Juicebox. Funds raised will be routed to the DAO treasury to support protocol development.\r\n\r\nThe beta version of the protocol is already live on both Rinkeby and Mainnet.\r\n\r\nDuring the next days we'll release the main version of the protocol, with greatly improved efficiency and capabilities. Here are some of the features that will be introduced:\r\nERC20 splitting between slicer owners\r\nProduct purchases with ERC20 tokens\r\nDynamic product pricing for ETH (via Chainlink, based on USD)\r\nDynamic product pricing for ERC20 tokens (via Uniswap, based on ETH)\r\nCustom contract call (hook) executable upon product purchase\r\nList NFTs for sale directly from slicers\r\nTransfer and currency withdraw timelocks\r\nControlled slicers: Fully controlled by a single address (controller) who can transfer slices between addresses or mint/burn them on demand. Slicer owners are only able to collect any payment that is due to them.","reference_url":"https://slice.so","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/187ce1658e34879f202f14069d43c731/Group_163.jpg","admin_address":"0xAe009d532328FF09e09E5d506aB5BBeC3c25c0FF","amount_received":"60.1171","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-105994994,"related":[[12,7],[13,5],[4975,4],[4846,4],[4832,4],[4816,4],[5386,3],[5130,3],[5051,3],[5014,3],[4971,3],[4866,3],[4830,3],[4726,3],[4722,3],[4669,3],[4268,3],[4186,3],[4019,3],[4017,3],[3641,3],[3591,3],[2841,3],[2767,3],[2743,3],[2323,3],[821,3],[5427,3],[4959,2],[4790,2],[3814,2],[3522,2],[2229,2],[1805,2],[1669,2],[1110,2],[4665,2],[5288,2],[1102,2],[191,2],[5007,2],[4939,2],[4134,2],[5348,2],[4083,2],[2805,2],[599,2],[5041,2],[4827,2],[4597,1],[4879,1],[3531,1],[3384,1],[1632,1],[172,1],[4655,1],[4573,1],[3358,1],[490,1],[4151,1],[4753,1],[4517,1],[4499,1],[4310,1],[2922,1],[2851,1],[1534,1],[795,1],[223,1],[25,1],[5369,1],[5367,1],[5365,1],[5352,1],[4938,1],[4932,1],[4929,1],[4927,1],[4926,1],[4924,1],[4922,1],[4896,1],[4889,1],[4882,1],[4878,1],[5435,1],[5422,1],[5409,1],[5399,1],[5296,1],[5290,1],[5272,1],[5257,1],[5248,1],[5245,1],[5241,1],[5237,1],[5236,1],[5224,1],[5215,1],[5214,1],[5205,1],[5191,1],[5189,1],[5184,1],[5164,1],[5155,1],[5148,1],[5140,1],[5138,1],[5137,1],[5135,1],[5134,1],[5129,1],[5119,1],[5118,1],[5117,1],[5092,1],[5091,1],[5090,1],[5084,1],[5082,1],[5081,1],[5040,1],[5039,1],[5035,1],[5033,1],[5027,1],[5025,1],[5023,1],[5017,1],[5016,1],[5008,1],[5005,1],[4998,1],[4981,1],[4977,1],[4972,1],[4964,1],[4953,1],[4949,1],[4945,1],[4920,1],[4919,1],[4914,1],[4913,1],[4898,1],[4875,1],[4874,1],[4863,1],[4861,1],[4857,1],[4840,1],[4836,1],[4804,1],[5468,1],[5440,1],[5452,1],[4069,1],[4054,1],[4024,1],[3998,1],[2121,1],[1628,1],[1595,1],[1211,1],[1155,1],[855,1],[5402,1],[4786,1],[5180,1],[5075,1],[5060,1],[5042,1],[5036,1],[4751,1],[4678,1],[4640,1],[4639,1],[4575,1],[4367,1],[4246,1],[4091,1],[3951,1],[3116,1],[3062,1],[2985,1],[2952,1],[2840,1],[2823,1],[2599,1],[539,1],[517,1]],"upcoming":-100012000,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1648628643.563654,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1648663334.0828164,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1648662710.5282884},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":345624,"url":"/jjranalli","name":"Jacopo","handle":"jjranalli","keywords":["TypeScript","JavaScript"],"position":410,"followers":7,"following":7,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/30cb03b60bd11a811a945905152f19f5/jjranalli.png","github_url":"https://github.com/jjranalli","grants_owned":1,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":0},"team_members":[{"id":345624,"url":"/jjranalli","name":"Jacopo","handle":"jjranalli","keywords":["TypeScript","JavaScript"],"position":410,"followers":7,"following":7,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/30cb03b60bd11a811a945905152f19f5/jjranalli.png","github_url":"https://github.com/jjranalli","grants_owned":1,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":0}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"60.1171","positive_round_contributor_count":6,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/187ce1658e34879f202f14069d43c731/Group_163.jpg"],"details_url":"/grants/5268/slice"},{"id":5265,"active":true,"title":"Allchains","slug":"allchains","description":"About\r\nAllchains is an all-in-one decentralized app that allows users to track their full portfolio through various chains and help users automatically add blockchain networks to their wallets, manage assets, and other core features such as cryptocurrency data aggregator, swap and bridge enabling users to perform token swap for token exchange and discover investment opportunities through detailed real-time data\r\nProblem\r\nIt is difficult for new users to check what is in their wallets.\r\nUsers need to access a different web page for each basic feature.\r\nWeb pages interface are difficult to use, not user-friendly.\r\nSolution\r\nAllchains uses Covalent API.

We’re curating a wealthverse with the mission to guide millions of womxn and traditionally underrepresented groups on a journey to build financial well-being using the ethereum and web3 ecosystem. \r\n\r\nEve Wealth is quickly becoming the definitive resource to find and evaluate wealth building opportunities in web3. We are decentralizing and democratizing personal finance education in this new era of emerging financial opportunities with DeFi. \r\n \r\nThe Visionaries\r\n \r\nAll of our educational content, guides, technical support and podcast is led by the Wealth Coaches & Experts in Eve's Wealthverse DAO. The community currently has over 500 members and the DAO is made up of over 25 experts in personal finance across levels including finance101, asset allocation, decentralized finance (L1 & L2), real estate (including virtual land), alternative investments (including art & NFTs), crypto taxes, charitable giving strategies (including contributing to DAOs) and more. \r\n\r\nImagine one destination where the top voices in personal finance curate the best resources for learning the levels of a wealth journey, so everyone can level up. \r\n\r\nBuilding the Wealthverse\r\n\r\nExpanding on our successful launch of our DeFi course with a feminine lens, our weekly publication featuring top voices in web3 wealth building, and our expert led discord levels with Poaps as Proof of Knowledge including a member library of investment portfolios to learn from - we’re excited to build the next phase. \r\n\r\nOur wealthverse protocol acts as the open-source public good that guide users transformation from fear to financial well-being. \r\n\r\nOur priorities: \r\n\r\n1) Research guides & workshops: pioneer new models of industry-sharing research. Reward research contributors for developing investment guides that tackle the most pertinent opportunities and challenges in web3 financial-wellness. Include a public directory - host 100 project pages, 75 wealth coach profiles, host 200 jobs, and connect 50 deals (get more women on cap tables). Establish a scalable contributor program for researchers, wealth coaches, analysts and other core talent. Support 75 wealth coaches across circles, workshops and events. Define governance structures to advance the movement. \r\n\r\n2) Podcast: elevate critical thinking in crypto by curating discussions between experts in TradFi and DeFi to debate common rebuttals to web3 and encourage constructive evaluation of blockchain implications on everyday life and future security (8 episodes for season 1) \r\n\r\n3) Web3 Helpline: set up an easy text number with a community-run FAQ to help with the small technical challenges that can often halt newbies from getting started. We will have text-based support for wallets, NFTs, Discord and other tech challenges with the option to schedule 1:1 video call help by donation. \r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s change the game, together! \r\n\r\nFinancial well-being is a fundamental building block for higher-order thinking and human progress. Yet, there is an enormous lack of objective guidance and impartial educational content to support someone’s wealth journey. There are 258.3 million adults in the United States, but only 91,990 Certified Financial Planners (these are qualified experts to give financial advice). Even if each of them had 100 clients, they would only be able to support 4% of the population. Legacy institutions, including Banks, Wealth Managers and even the Department of Education, are not going to cut it in terms of Global coordination problems - especially when it comes to building the basics for financial well-being. If you don’t come from a wealthy finance-savvy family, are a first generation wealth builder or don’t have $1M in assets for a financial advisor to work with you - you’re on your own. \r\n\r\nPrivate companies and capital are also struggling to fill the gap. As each individual venture backed company races to prove growth, traction, attention, low cost to acquire customers and high lifetime value - the people who need support get lost. Founders struggle with high cost to acquire users and intense content creation burden, or they end up losing the ability to support  impartial education as a result of the pressure to create a sustainable business model around affiliate partners or user selling data. These are the common problems of web 1 and 2. \r\n\r\nWe are at the beginning of the next wealth revolution, $30 trillion in assets are moving from baby boomers (mostly to women) and 47% of millennial millionaires have more than 25% of their wealth in crypto. Decentralized finance is creating new models and frameworks for financial systems, and what might be difficult to catch up on 100s of years of traditional finance, is less cumbersome to educate on a few years of decentralized finance. \r\n\r\nWomxn and traditionally underrepresented groups in finance and investing are in particular need of guidance:\r\n\r\n+ Women make up less than 30% of most investing platforms\r\n+ If given $25K to invest, less than half (47%) would know what steps to take to do so\r\n+ 65% of women say they’d be more likely to invest if they had clear steps to do so\r\n+ 77% said if they had an advisor to help them invest, they’d feel more confident about their financial future\r\n\r\nWe can’t build a new system of decentralized finance without diversity. \r\n\r\nDAOs are also opening up the possibility for people to come together digitally, globally, and in new ways of organizing that put community at the center of value. We imagine a world where anyone can learn to build financial health in a trusted, safe space. Where coaches, experts and educators are curated to teach each of the fundamental levels, so that everyone can level up. \r\n\r\nJoin our mission to decentralize and democratize wealth building in a

Health - health and longevity services for everyone, everywhere","slug":"billions-health-health-and-longevity-services-for","description":"We want to enable everyone, everywhere to live a long and healthy life. To start, we’re building a health and longevity coaching platform built on web3 which allows everyone to own their own health data while reaping the upside of contributing their data to health discoveries. \r\n\r\n📈 We are drowning in health data, but struggling to make it actionable\r\n\r\nAround 100 million people have done a consumer genetic test, there are 100 million Apple watch users worldwide and there are around 1.8 billion health and fitness app downloads per year. Innovative new tests, wearables and implantable devices are being developed as we speak. Yet every user we’ve spoken to tells us they have lots of health-related data but don’t know what to do with it, while private companies are using their data to generate profit.\r\n\r\nIncredible breakthroughs are happening in health and longevity, but it’s hard to keep up - and to know what these new discoveries mean uniquely for you. Also, gathering insights is only the first step. To make sustained lifestyle changes, it’s important to utilise the trifecta of nutrition and training education, an accountable community, and data-driven personalization using behavioural psychology.\r\n\r\n❤️ Health and longevity coaches can make our health data actionable\r\n\r\nWe believe the solution is to provide health and longevity coaches, who are well-versed in the latest health and longevity research and know how to translate this for individuals in a personalised, actionable way.\r\n\r\nWe’re building a platform to enable people to aggregate and own all their health-relevant data - with access managed and audited via blockchain technology. Specifically, we will use off-chain data storage (initially cloud-based, but plan to move to decentralised storage) with consent and record of data access stored on-chain.\r\n\r\nIndividuals can share their data with coaches in a trustless and transparent way while retaining control and ownership of their own data. This will enable effortless sharing with other coaches and third parties outside of the platform.\r\n\r\nThe individual-owned data abstracted through the platform would become a valuable resource for research and fuel future longevity discoveries. People could optionally share their data and partake in research projects that interest them. This way we can widen access to health and longevity services and encourage research participation.\r\n\r\n🏡 From in-house expertise to a health services marketplace\r\n\r\nOur team has expertise in genetic analysis (especially determining disease risk through polygenic risk scores), AI models for personalised nutrition, continuous blood glucose analysis, sleep optimisation, monitoring mental health and matching to therapies. \r\n\r\nAs the user base grows, we plan to open up the platform and enable anybody to apply to offer their coaching services through the platform after being vetted. The creation of this health and longevity coaching marketplace would offer several advantages:\r\n\r\n(1) It enables more ‘rare expertise’ on the platform. For example, coaches with deep insight into particular medical conditions and how they influence the approach to health and longevity\r\n\r\n(2) Greater accessibility. Different coaches can charge at alternative price points - and we will encourage discounts for people who traditionally struggle with health access.\r\n\r\n😃 Our team\r\n\r\nChris Lovejoy is a medical doctor and machine learning engineer (after studying medicine at Cambridge University and machine learning at University College London). He’s passionate about using science to enable longevity and was a part of the winning team at the Longevity Hackathon 2022.\r\n\r\nAli Rizvi has a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Oxford. He has extensive experience building technology for public health institutions, insurance providers, and data compliance systems. He wants to make it effortless for people to contribute to research studies that will help themselves and their communities.\r\n\r\nKarl Smith-Byrne is a Senior Molecular Epidemiologist at the Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford. He focuses on implementing multi-omic methods to better understand factors contributing to the aetiology, early detection, and prognosis of various cancers. He wants to change the fact that current research doesn't reflect the diversity of people and of diseases that we see in our wider populations.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n\r\n✅ Q1 2022 (DONE):\r\nConducted interviews with over 60 users to understand their health access pain points\r\nDeveloped a prototype for user validation and testing\r\nConducted prototype testing with users to sharpen the value proposition\r\nOn-boarded experts with different areas of relevant health and longevity expertise\r\n\r\n▶️ Q2 2022:\r\nContinue user testing and feedback with the beta version of our app\r\nContinue to bring health and longevity coaches on board to increase the breadth of expertise within our team\r\nDeploy data storage and management on multiple Testnets\r\n\r\n▶️ Q3 2022:\r\nLaunch data storage

is a cryptic crypto puzzle game which challenges users to \"find the keys\" (seed phrase) hidden within a puzzle. The puzzle will lead participants to various websites relevant to the web3 space with the intention of getting eyes onto various locations in web3 e.g. encouraging users to visit Github, which if they haven't done before should be an educational experience. \r\n\r\nThe longer term vision of the project is to adapt it to either be used as a marketing project, leading users through various quests in search of the keys! (as a means for projects to get clicks on their pages or other content) or, a community based NFT ticketed event which is synonymous with crypto and web 3 culture. \r\n\r\nThe puzzles are currently designed as static web pages but could evolve into jpegs, videos, dialogue and perhaps even VR experiences (think VR escape room where participants are in a race to solve the puzzle and unlock the wallet). However, let's not use the \"metaverse\" buzzword here. This is far more rudimentary than that... (Until we can hire devs).\r\n\r\nSolving the puzzle should pit you and the entire crypto community in a race to \"hack\" the clues with prizes and clout (which may be provable through NFTs) on the line. \r\n\r\nDonations will be used to fund the prizes for the first iteration of the puzzle, promotion, improvements to the quality of our website/puzzles etc. Do not expect any form of reimbursement from contribution to this grant.\r\n\r\nAny support in the form of contribution in our discord is also welcome. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading this far :)\r\n& good luck finding the keys! to be crowned one of CT's smartest!","reference_url":"https://findthekeys.fun/","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/bbe744e403fffc3452f44f39bc3631f8/Find_the_Keys-03.png","admin_address":"0x5b16d8c6a5d59619b8fdd618c2004bce859e2d2a","amount_received":"0.0000","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-106000000,"upcoming":-100020000,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1648663731.2337737,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1648663335.2479546},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":342522,"url":"/smalltimexplorer","name":"smalltimexplorer","handle":"smalltimexplorer","keywords":[],"position":0,"followers":9,"following":10,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/61c03f9058fec031bd4b3baccb49b20b/smalltimexplorer.png","github_url":"https://github.com/smalltimexplorer","grants_owned":1,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":9},"team_members":[{"id":342522,"url":"/smalltimexplorer","name":"smalltimexplorer","handle":"smalltimexplorer","keywords":[],"position":0,"followers":9,"following":10,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/61c03f9058fec031bd4b3baccb49b20b/smalltimexplorer.png","github_url":"https://github.com/smalltimexplorer","grants_owned":1,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":9}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"0.0000","positive_round_contributor_count":0,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/bbe744e403fffc3452f44f39bc3631f8/Find_the_Keys-03.png"],"details_url":"/grants/5251/findthekeys"},{"id":5249,"active":true,"title":"Yearn Loans Finance is platform for crypto assets and Staking, liquidity farming, vault, and vote.

Lodge","slug":"hack-lodge","description":"🏡 Hack Lodge is an immersive software development program for undergrads. Participants spend a week together, shipping polished prototypes by demo day.\r\n\r\n💎 This January, we ran our first crypto-themed Hack Lodge to great success. We plan to run another one this summer.\r\n\r\n📆 Hack Lodge is a 501c3 non-profit. We've run these events since 2018 with funding from SPARC, Neo, the Ethereum Foundation, 0xPARC, and individual donors.\r\n\r\n⚡️Past participants of Hack Lodge in the last four years include the founders of multiple crypto- and web3-adjacent projects, including Dark Forest, 0xPARC, ETHUniversity, and Gather.Town.\r\n\r\nProgram feedback has been overwhelmingly positive since the inception of the program. Our W20 participants responded to \"How likely would you be to recommend Hack Lodge to a friend?\" with a median score of 10/10.\r\n\"One of the most formative experiences for me as an engineer\"\r\n\"Organic experiences like this don't happen frequently\"\r\n\"I can't think of another time I've gotten to meet and learn from such amazing people\"\r\n\"Hack Lodge enabled us to build in one week what would've taken a whole semester\"\r\n\"Hack Lodge was one of the most inspiring weeks of my life, hands-down\"\r\n\r\nHack Lodge is entirely run on donations and grants. We're efficient. So far we've averaged just over $10k per ~-20-person event.

Index - Season One","slug":"values-index-season-one","description":"About\r\n \r\nWe envision a world where investing in crypto can be synonymous with investing in your values. Our goal is to launch the first crypto index fund that incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. \r\n \r\nWe believe that data is a public good. We can only have informed conversations around climate impact, diversity and inclusion in web3 when projects are incentivized to share information about how they operate. \r\n \r\nWe are raising funds to support our first phase of development: creating an open-source database for ESG metrics in web3. This includes an extensive list of values-based metrics for protocols, backed by industry leading data, for anyone to use as a sustainable investing solution.\r\n \r\nWhat is the Values Index doing?\r\n\r\n1) We are establishing a home for the web3 values-based investing movement \r\n2) We are mobilizing a collaborative research initiative to collect data on leadership, boards, employees, social following, GitHub contributions, proof of stake, carbon offset, funded D&I initiatives, and more\r\n3) We are developing the industry-standard scoring methodology for the ESG impact of web3 projects & protocols\r\n4) We are building products that enable people to invest in projects & protocols aligned with their values \r\n5) We are creating content and communities that onboard new audiences into purpose-driven blockchain projects & action around topics like climate, gender equality and racial justice in the web3 space \r\n \r\nWhat progress have we made?\r\n \r\nIn just two months since we brought together 10 leaders in the crypto investing & education space, we have: \r\n\r\n+ Launched a market research study with over 492 participants (see it here) \r\n+ Published our research findings & are building in public (follow our Notion) \r\n+ Presented the initiative on main stage at ETHDenver (watch our panel) \r\n+ Conducted initial data collection, scoring & backtesting for an ESG Layer 1 index \r\n+ Started engaging contributors (get involved here) & thought-leadership from partners like Set Protocol, Index Coop, Balancer, Gemini, and more. \r\n \r\nWhat's next?\r\n\r\nWe’ve got 3 initiatives in phase 1 and our Gitcoin grant round target is $300k to support this. \r\n \r\n1) Collaborative Research Institute & data acquisition - publish open-source framework & scoring tools for ESG ($50K) \r\n2) Index Product - launch an extensive list of values-based metrics for protocols, backed by industry leading data, for anyone to use as a sustainable investing solution ($150K) \r\n3) Contributor Program & DAO Governance - establish a scalable contributor program for researchers, developers, analysts and other core talent. Define governance structures to advance the movement ($100K) \r\n \r\nWhy now?\r\n \r\n+ We are in the next wealth revolution: 47% of millennial millionaires have more than 25% of their wealth in crypto\r\n+ What happened in TradFi will happen in DeFi: In 2016, when Morningstar first started publishing the climate footprint of mutual funds, $15B left those funds to ones with higher sustainability scores. Today 99% of millennials are interested in the ESG strategies of the companies they invest in. Give people meaningful data, and they’ll respond to it.\r\n+ It took 20 years for ESG to enter TradFi. We don’t want to wait that long this time.\r\n+ We surveyed 492 people about values-based crypto index products: Over 70% want to invest in protocols that consider climate & gender equality. 51% would be willing to invest more than $5,000 in a crypto index fund of the top 10 protocols that consider people, planet & profit\r\n\r\nThere is a current lack of data for diversity, equity and inclusion for blockchain protocols. Efforts to create this criteria and data in TradFi have been very successful (see The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) established in 1997).\r\n \r\nIt’s time we brought values-aligned investing to crypto.

Weekend","slug":"complexity-weekend","description":"Complexity Weekend \r\nComplexity Weekend is a global community of practice based around learning and applying Complexity Science to real-world challenges (aka wicked problems). \r\nWe see Communities of Practice as a public good, and highlight various dimensions of what such communities can contribute to the commons such as: individual upskilling/reskilling, education, social cohesion, accessibility, mentorship, global connections, innovation, knowledge management, etc. \r\nWe seek to develop Complexity Weekend as a public good, and also serve as a template, incubator, and inspiration for other communities + public goods. \r\nWe have validated the efficacy of this trifecta since we started in 2019.\r\nOne of the societal concerns that Complexity Weekend seeks to address is developing effective team-based collaboration despite physical distancing over a diverse community of participants. CW helps us form small teams in biannual cohorts (along the lines of squads) that compose the community (team-of-teams model with distributed organization). Participants are exposed to different facets/aspects of complexity to help them develop this understanding over time, which is reinforced through monthly community gatherings online.\r\nFundamentally, we are interested in helping individuals/teams apply Complexity Science and develop approaches that address some of the most challenging issues facing our communities and world. \r\nWe are always open to participation from individuals of all backgrounds, time zones, and levels of familiarity with Complexity Science. All participants are welcome to step up into Facilitator or Organizer roles in our community. Please feel free to get involved! See our website for upcoming events, or join our mailing list to stay up-to-date.\r\nBelow are two visual descriptions of our community, pulled from Organizer slide decks at recent events (the first description is structural/role-based, and the second is time-based):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStats since our 2019 start (biannual cohorts / monthly community events): \r\nParticipants so far: ~500\r\nFacilitators so far: ~75\r\nCo-Organizers: ~25\r\nVolunteer Committees: ~5\r\nSupporters & Associates: ~10\r\n\r\nA great public good should:\r\nBe values-based — it’s in service of a set of values your community cares about.\r\nThe values of Complexity Weekend have driven our community since the beginning, and also reflect our community’s evolution over time, as anyone is welcome to provide feedback and mutate our values over time. More information, and a history of community feedback, can be found in our Living Our Purpose And Values document. \r\nThe current state of our 3 key values are:\r\nLearn by Doing\r\nInclude to Innovate (through inclusivity and diversity) \r\nServe through Deep Time (in the periods between high-energy building phases, and into the deep future)\r\nMaximizing diversity among participants, relationships, teams, projects\r\nComplexity Science is an area of research, but also application, communication, and design. We take a “Complexity-first” approach to our own community organizing, and in this way hope to increase our understanding while also finding connection, meaning, and impact. CW organizers are just another team in our community of practice, learning Complexity by doing!\r\nThe values of the CW community inform the behavior of the diverse teams that participate in or form during CW events, as well as individuals.\r\n\r\nHave longevity — it’s achievable and maintainable.\r\nAs noted above in the Values section, “Serve through Deep Time” is a central value in our community. This manifests in several ways:\r\nWe plan our events with a regular rhythm, and plan to maintain this rhythm carrying forward. Specifically, two times per year we have a high-energy cohort-based Weekend experience, with a focus on forming remote project-based teams that will last long beyond the Weekend itself. In the other 10 months of the year that do not have Weekends, we have shorter informal community Heartbeat events. \r\nOur first events were in-person in 2019, and since 2020 we have been all-online. This pivot to online has been important for including global participants, and reflected our commitment to resilience amidst uncertainty and changing circumstances. \r\nOur YouTube channel displays the public-facing Livestreams from each of our Weekend and Heartbeat events. For each of these events, other than the Livestreams, all activities are interactive and unrecorded. \r\nWe emphasize that in all teams and projects – whether the applications of Complexity that the teams engage in, or the organization of Complexity Weekend itself – a Deep Time perspective is considered and deliberated. \r\nTo provide some statistics on our participation from the previous November 2021 Weekend: \r\nWe draw from the total spectrum of familiarity with Complexity – at every event there are participants who are extremely familiar with the area, as well as “Complexity Curious” (complete beginners to the space). We emphasize “learning by doing” and maintaining a beginner’s mind, to increase accessibility across these dimensions. We hope this will continue to scaffold intergenerational, cross-sector, global interactions. \r\n~160 participants from 50+ countries were involved in our previous November 2021 Weekend cohort ! Across all events, we estimate there have been 500+ active participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo provide a few examples of Keynote speakers & Facilitators at CW in the past: Dave Snowden (Cynefin, sensemaking), Michael Zargham (computational governance, digital twin modeling), Krzysztof Paruch (crypto-economics), Jeff Emmett (token engineering, computer-aided governance), Diamantis Sellis (complex systems modeling), Palma Strand (legal complexity, dialogue, Civity), Monica Kang (entrepreneurship & innovation), Michaela Emch (biomimicry, communication), and many more.\r\nThere are around 30 Facilitators per biannual cohort, and 3-5 per monthly Heartbeat – see our website for the latest set of Facilitators to get a sense of the diversity.\r\nWe draw Facilitators from our community of participants. As with all CW roles, Facilitation is an event-specific role, not a special class of person. \r\n\r\nCreate positive externalities — it benefits a public beyond an immediate set of users.\r\nAccessibility - a public coworking space (the Atrium) is always-online and available in cyber-physical space. It is open to global participation at any moment of the day. The Atrium is activated every month during the Heartbeat events, and during weekly coworking times. Currently, we use Gather (Synchronous) and Keybase (Asynchronous) as our main technological platforms.\r\nWhile we hope that the Participants of Complexity Weekend enjoy and benefit from their engagement directly, we aim for impact beyond our community. Teams are encouraged to grow beyond the CW community (and to return to our monthly heartbeats or future biannual cohorts to stay connected/keep learning together/refresh their connections to Applied Complexity Science)\r\nAt the individual scale, Participants can extend their familiarity with Complexity into their work and life. \r\nAt the team scale, projects scaffolded by the Complexity Weekend community can expect to benefit from feedback and opportunities while having positive impacts on their system of interests.\r\n\r\nWhere this Gitcoin grant fits into Complexity Weekend:\r\nWe are already a decentralized, engaged, and diverse community of practice. \r\nIn line with our values (e.g. inclusion, service through deep time, etc), we want to increase global participation over the coming years, as well as develop tools for online governance, funding, and community stewardship. Hence we believe that increased engagement with the individuals and organizations involved in this call for proposals would be mutually-beneficial (increase awareness/familiarity of Complexity within the internet/crypto domains while bolstering participation and cutting-edge expertise in our community). \r\nWithout a native token, DAO formalization, or a particular project to assemble around, we’ve developed a healthy global community with distributed Organizers + Facilitators. We hope to develop further in the coming years using new digital affordances for communities, including computationally-aided modeling and design of governance structures, communication, and economic ecosystems. On these fronts, we would benefit greatly from interaction with Facilitators, Participants, and Organizers within the Gitcoin and Other Internet communities.\r\n\r\nContact

ground in Ukraine from Day 1 of War. WOC has been working in Ukraine for many years supporting children orphanages and those who needed assistance. That is why they have existing infrastructure in place to meet the needs for those most vulnerable at the moment. WOC is small but effective. All their supplies are donated in US through large distributor such as Henry Scheine and Pharmaceutical companies such as J&J worth millions of dollars. WOC has warehouses through various partner organizations in the south from Mississippi to Tennessee. WOC also has a warehouse in Poland on the border with Ukraine. WOC has been setting up IDP camps on the Ukraine border to take in refuges and providing critical and urgent medical supplies, medications and emergency food for babies. Everyone in the organization is a volunteer. Nobody has a salary and nobody makes a penny on your donations.\r\nEach dollar goes towards the relief effort. Not many organizations can make that claim. WOC can!\r\nWOC usually has logistics part covered due to grants they hold with US government; but due to the critical situation in Ukraine much of this funding was frozen and now they need your help for logistical part to get these supplies to their warehouse in Poland. As of today WOC has 500+ pallets of critical supplies that we need to get to Ukraine. In Ukraine, WOC has partners who can help with transportation to get the supplies to hospitals and other hot points.\r\nWOC is working with METL https://metl.co that is providing custody services for

Resilience in Working Landscapes","slug":"pollinator-resilience-in-working-landscapes","description":"This project will provide innovative mechanisms to fund pollinator habitat enhancement in working landscapes in Oregon’s Willamette Valley, with the potential to be adapted in other regions.\r\n\r\nThe Problem: \r\nAlarming declines in pollinator populations have been noted in ecological research in recent years. Efforts to reverse these declines are often funded by entities such as local governments, conservation districts, and nonprofit organizations. These projects are charismatic and highly visible, but despite these efforts, the impacts on native pollinators have not abated. \r\n\r\nFurther complicating matters are the often out-of-date biological models and climate data used to assess habitat suitability for pollinator species. Adapting these tools to current and forecasted conditions will be essential to the success of pollinator protection in the future.\r\n\r\nFinally, land stewards face serious barriers participating in these efforts, including risks and learning curves associated with changing production practices, payoffs that can take years to materialize, and benefits of management activities that are difficult to monitor and measure \r\n\r\nProject Solutions:\r\nWe propose to develop a continuous funding platform for pollinator habitat in working and landscapes. Our initial effort will be focused on the agriculturally diverse Willamette Valley in Oregon, in partnership with fruit and tree nut farmers, landscape nursery growers, university researchers, and conservation organizations.\r\n\r\nOur proposed ecological credit market will provide a new way for conservation funders in the region to allocate their spending, along with new remote sensing and impact measurement tools. \r\n\r\nProject Background: \r\nBeginning in 2019, we have been working to develop novel remote sensing tools to monitor and measure flying organisms (insects, birds, and bats) with funding from the National Science Foundation and the State of Oregon. In October 2021, we launched a companion project to develop spatially-explicit population models for insect species of importance to agriculture. \r\n\r\nProject Objectives:\r\nThe goal of the overall project is to create a model for cooperative entities dedicated to enhancing ecosystems on working lands. Specific elements/objectives include:\r\n\r\nCreating a knowledge production system for generating ecological data (e.g., through IoT and remote sensing data), assessing climate impacts on agro-ecosystems, and maintaining know-how relating to biodiversity and food production.\r\nDeveloping an open modeling toolkit for predicting species habitat suitability and measuring abundance and the impacts of management decisions on species of interest, with a focus on pollinators.\r\nProviding financial and governance technologies to align economic and ecological interests of land stewards, including direct compensation to land stewards for regenerative practices.\r\nBuild tools for verifying management practices and ecological outcomes using distributed ledger technologies\r\n\r\nProject Plan: \r\nJanuary - March 2022: Begin developing methodologies to record and monitor ecological indicators for pollinator habitat creation\r\nApril - June 2022: Build and secure habitat creation funding from public and private sources\r\n\r\nAt this early stage, success would be defined as the establishment of a cooperative governance entity consisting of producers and land stewards in the Willamette River basin and its approximately one million acres devoted to agriculture.","reference_url":"https://pollinator.opensensory.net/","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/89bceda0ebcdc653198425e14ac0ddf4/bee-box.png","admin_address":"0x0","amount_received":"0.0000","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-106000000,"related":[],"upcoming":-100020000,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1648628983.0337625,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1648663737.6473026,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1648663340.981398},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":348249,"url":"/node-econ","name":"Kyle Birchard","handle":"node-econ","keywords":["Jupyter Notebook","CSS","HTML"],"position":0,"followers":0,"following":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/b03c87a672ef4f451e6de126987ff4b3/node-econ.png","github_url":"https://github.com/node-econ","grants_owned":1,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":0},"team_members":[{"id":348249,"url":"/node-econ","name":"Kyle Birchard","handle":"node-econ","keywords":["Jupyter Notebook","CSS","HTML"],"position":0,"followers":0,"following":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/b03c87a672ef4f451e6de126987ff4b3/node-econ.png","github_url":"https://github.com/node-econ","grants_owned":1,"total_earned":0,"organizations":{},"grants_contributed":0}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"0.0000","positive_round_contributor_count":0,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/89bceda0ebcdc653198425e14ac0ddf4/bee-box.png"],"details_url":"/grants/5226/pollinator-resilience-in-working-landscapes"},{"id":5224,"active":true,"title":"Game Development from Web2 to Web3 Educational Series","slug":"game-development-from-web2-to-web3-educational-se","description":"What is this grant for?\r\n\r\nA free educational video series to help onboard more traditional game developers to web3.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of traditional game developers? Ones like myself!\r\n\r\nI started getting paid as a game developer in 2007 working with Flash to make games for branded portals like Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and others. Worked on Facebook games too.\r\n\r\nThen moved to making games for the iPhone and iPad. Shipped a couple of indie titles and worked on countless game clones for brands as part of marketing campaigns.\r\n\r\nEventually switched to Unity for mobile games and had a stint at Zynga working on social casino titles.\r\n\r\nOurcade was started with the goal of helping move web games forward so that there would be a viable and open platform for games outside of app stores.\r\n\r\nMuch of Ourcade's efforts so far has been in creating educational content in the form of written tutorials, videos on YouTube, free beginner ebooks, source code on Github, and more.\r\n\r\nCrypto and decentralization was at the heart of Ourcade's inception even though I didn't know how it would fit together and, quite frankly, still don't. But I knew web and open source was the right direction. That's why Ourcade is focused on making games with Phaser 3 and other open source web libraries.\r\n\r\nWhere will the money go?\r\n\r\nI am likely to produce this series irrespective of the grant but it would be helpful in increasing the quality and production value as well as expedite it.\r\n\r\nI consider myself a web3 noob even though I've done Solidity tutorials, messed around with Loom and NEAR, and subscribe to more crypto newsletters than I really need to read.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to capture a more traditional game developer's journey in learning to make games in web3. The goal is to package that experience into something engaging and easy to digest by following the journey from knowing very little about web3 game development to being comfortable enough to start a web3 game using the map provided by this content.\r\n\r\nThe videos will aim to educate about the concepts, tools, languages, technologies, resources, reasoning, and whatever else might be important as they arise and do it in the most entertaining way I know how.\r\n\r\nYou can check out the Ourcade YouTube channel to get a feel for how things are explained. The videos in this series will likely be better versions of what's there as we try to improve with every video.\r\n\r\nThe content is not married to YouTube and should be posted to Odysee as well to reach more people.\r\n\r\nAll source code created as part of this video series will be made available on Github.\r\n\r\nThe exact demo game that this project will end up building is TBD but it will likely use Phaser 3.

Alert: a technology-based forest protection method for preventing deforestation on indigenous peoples' lands","slug":"rainforest-alert-a-technology-based-forest-protec","description":"Our vision is to change the paradigm of international financing and verification mechanisms related to environmental services and carbon sequestration. \r\n\r\nRainforest Alert - Rainforest Foundation’s model of empowering indigenous communities living in the Amazon rainforest to utilize satellite data, drones and smartphones for monitoring territories against illegal deforestation has proven successful at reducing deforestation and is backed by a scientific study proving its efficacy.\r\n\r\nThe communities this initiative will serve live in extreme poverty, sustaining themselves by hunting, fishing, gathering and tending to small farm plots. Apart from this, they occasionally gain income through selling fish or logging. The communities have suffered from and are vulnerable to outside threats to their natural resources, particularly illegal mining, logging, and coca cultivation. \r\n\r\nThey are vulnerable to these threats because there is virtually no government presence in this remote region, and sometimes they are forced to participate in unsustainable activities in order to survive, as they need some income for basic necessities. This program will serve entire communities, counting on the participation of women, children, youth, and the elderly, ensuring collective buy-in and ownership of the program. \r\n\r\nParticipating communities will create a long-term land management plan that will include a commitment to conserve at least 80% of their remaining forested area. We will train community members to utilize remote sensing technology, drones and smartphones to better survey their lands against illegal deforestation.\r\n\r\nThe Rainforest Alert process consists of 5 action steps:\r\n\r\nDETECT: Forest loss is picked up by satellite and recorded in Global Forest Watch, a free web app\r\nALERT: Technicians in a regional data hub receive the deforestation alert and save the data to a memory card\r\nTRANSPORT: Couriers transport the memory card by boat to the affected, off-grid indigenous community\r\nINVESTIGATE & DOCUMENT: Forest patrollers travel to the site associated with the alert and/or view the area remotely by drone to investigate and document deforestation activity. \r\nACTION: Forest patrollers present evidence to community assemblies, who decide on an appropriate course of action\r\n\r\nWe are also developing an online platform (largely funded by Gitcoin users) that enables individuals and companies to give results-based payments to participating indigenous communities that are effectively protecting or replanting forest. It applies blockchain technology towards creating a transparent, immutable, and trusted record of the impact of reforestation and conservation efforts and powers the creation of a sustainable results-based flow of funding to vulnerable communities. Direct payments to communities will be based on evidence from satellite data that projects have had a successful impact. \r\n\r\nWe aim to demonstrate this evidence-based model of investment in frontline communities as a sustainable solution to the climate crisis and leverage investment to scale this program across forest communities throughout the Amazon and beyond. \r\n\r\nThe Amazon not only contains 40% of the world’s remaining rainforest and 25% of its terrestrial biodiversity, but it also plays a significant role in drawing down global carbon emissions from the atmosphere and keeping the global environment stable. Trees in the Amazon rainforest absorb roughly 600,000 million tons of carbon each year, but when these trees are felled, burned, or die, they not only lose their ability to absorb that level of carbon, but they release the carbon they have been storing, making deforestation immensely harmful for our global environment.
